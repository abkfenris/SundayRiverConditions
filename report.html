<h4><strong>January 30, 2023 | 7:18 AM</strong></h4><h4><strong style="font-size: 2em;">Morning Report</strong></h4><p>And a good morning to all our skiers and riders! We're happy to report that all of our regular grooming got taken care of, and we even added <strong>Wildfire</strong> to the list of groomed trails! That said, the temps were pretty warm when the cats rolled out and dropped through the night, meaning that conditions will be fast and firm. Nothing we can't handle, but it won't cut like butter that's been sitting on the counter but more like butter that's just been taken out of the fridge.&nbsp;</p><p>Temps look to stay reasonably consistent today, hovering around that mid-20 mark for most of the day. There is also an <strong>event on T2 and Monday Morning</strong>. A crossing guard will be stationed at the cutover to allow access to Cascades. Additionally, snowmaking will be coming online before opening on Dream Maker and running throughout the day as temps allow. Besides that, it's business as usual.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;See you out there!<br />-Team Snow</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
