<h4><strong>January 18, 2023 | 7:30 AM</strong></h4><h2><strong>Morning Report</strong><span></span></h2><p>Snowcats took to the slopes last night to smooth out and clean up all the snowmaking we have had in the past few days. They got to the entire mountain putting down those perfect stripes on all open terrain. We have 13 lifts and 73 trails scheduled for today. With over 400 acres of open skiable terrain, there should be plenty of opportunities for smooth carves and fun lines all over our eight peaks.</p><p>Temps will stay around the mid-30s all day, allowing snow surfaces to soften up as the day goes on. This weather will keep the conditions in good shape for the Week ahead. The future forecast looks promising for the next few days, as possible snowfall and colder temps are heading our way. As always, keep an eye on our Mountain Report as the day goes on for updated lift statuses and trail conditions.</p><p>See you on the slopes!<br />-Team Snow</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
