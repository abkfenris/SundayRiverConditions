Afternoon Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: February 8, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 1:26 PM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>We have some balmy temps out there today, folks, and some soft corduroy to match. Shock Wave also made its season debut this morning, so be sure to check that out for some ungroomed fun. We're looking at slightly cooler temps tomorrow with mostly cloudy skies and a chance of flurries throughout the morning.&nbsp;</p><p>Due to the warmer temperatures tonight, our grooming team will be giving the snow guns a break. They'll be working on getting snow guns set up on a few other trails across the mountain to continue resurfacing. Our grooming team will be laying stripes on our standard midweek trails, and they'll also be setting up Rogue Angel with some new corduroy. First tracks on Rogue Angel tomorrow should be great, so don't forget to head that way in the morning. Rocking Chair is coming along well, and our parks team will continue working on the build.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/presidents-week" title="Presidents' Week | Sunday River, Maine">Presidents' Week</a> is creeping up on us, and we have events planned for the whole family.
