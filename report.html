<p><strong>February 14, 2022</strong></p><p>What is more romantic than flowers? Freshly made snow! Snowmakers are blasting guns on Right Stuff and T72, so you can ski snow stashes at 9AM with your special someone. Groomers put down corduroy on over 80 trails for you to carve into this morning. We have more than 100 trail options for you to choose from as you ski away your Monday blues. These temperatures are ideal for more piles of freshly made snow in the coming week, and we are so happy snowguns are blasting on our terrain already. Check out our exciting activities we have coming up for you across the resort in the next week. Start your week on the slopes and enjoy more terrain added to our list of snowmaking as you ski into this afternoon!</p><p>Little White Cap Quad will be closed for maintenance today. Please note at this time the Grand Summit Hotel is not accessible via beginner trails. All ski-in/out access to the Grand Summit Hotel temporarily requires navigation of intermediate and more advanced terrain.</p><p><strong>Around the Resort</strong></p><p>Celebrate love on the slopes today for <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/camp-valentines.xml" title="Valentine's Day">Valentine's Day</a>.
