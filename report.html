Looking ahead, we have have one more warm day coming up tomorrow before a stretch of cold temps move into the area. Our snowmaking team is ready to take advantage once that happens, with all eyes set on expanding our trail count.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to our downhill terrain, a 4-feature hike park is set up in Jordan, with a variety of boxes and rails.</p><p>If you need ticket assistance, a Guest Service station is located in the bottom terminal of the Jordan 8.
