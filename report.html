<strong>Lift tickets are sold out for Saturday, February 27</strong></p><p style="color: #696969; font-weight: 900; font-size: 12px;">Friday, February 26</p><div><p>Who's ready for another sunny day on the slopes? Lifts start spinning at 9AM today, and you can expect fast snow and terrain across all eight peaks. Due to chilly temps overnight, the natural trails may need some time to soften up in the sunshine, so carve out some time for groomed terrain first thing.&nbsp;And while today's forecast calls for full-on sunshine, we're looking at light snow all weekend long, plus fireworks on Saturday night.&nbsp;</p><p>Want to hit the slopes in March?
