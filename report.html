Morning Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: March 15, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 9:04 AM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>9AM Update: Our Mountain Ops team is reporting about 4" of snow at the top of White Cap.&nbsp;</p><p>Big flakes are currently falling from the sky, and our grooming team reports about 1" of accumulation at the peaks. It might not be a major storm, but it's certainly picturesque. It's currently in the low to mid-thirties across the mountain, and it shouldn't warm up too much. The snow should end around noon, and the cloudy skies are here to stay for the rest of the day.</p><p>Our grooming team laid stripes on 72 trails last night. All of our green terrain, most of our blue terrain, and some of our advanced terrain received a groom. Check out trails like Green Cheese and Cyclone for some relaxed turns or head over to Northern Lights and Sunday Punch for a more classic cruiser. Feeling the trees today? Set your sights on trails like Wizard's Gulch, Celestial, and Gnarnia for some fun in the glades. Make sure to check out the lift and terrain status below for the most up-to-date information.&nbsp;</p><p>Looking at season passes for next season? Buy your pass now, and ski this weekend.
