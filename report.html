Morning Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: December 10, 2023 </strong></em><strong>| 6:44 AM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>Happy Sunday, folks. Today we have over 250 acres of skiable terrain and 9 lifts spinning. We have some light fog this morning on the hill, but don't let that stop you from getting out there. With temps in the mid-thirties this morning, turns will be soft and lovely.</p><p>Our grooming team laid some corduroy down for us last night on the majority of our open trails. If you're looking for an extra challenge, head to Aludra, Boralis, and Airglow for some ungroomed terrain. We have a new pop-up park at the end of Easy Street today, as well, so keep an eye out for that. Please be aware that there is currently no beginner terrain off of the Chondola.&nbsp;</p><p>Don't forget to join us for Santa Sunday today! Spectators should head to South Ridge by 11AM. Pre-registered Santas should check in between 7:30-10:30AM this morning at the South Ridge Base Lodge.
