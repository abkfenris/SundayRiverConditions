<p><strong>November 22, 2022 | 7:52 AM</strong></p><p>We're off to another sunny start here in Western Maine. Our snowmaking and grooming teams have been out working their magic, preparing for the first full week of skiing and riding. Groomers made their first passes on Right Stuff, Cascades, and Lower Sunday Punch, lying down beautifully soft corduroy for this morning. We're in excellent shape heading into the holidays, with more terrain opening soon. If you're coming up for the holidays, don't forget to check out <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/thanksgiving-dinner">Thanksgiving Dinner at Camp.</a></p><p>While our excellent Mountain Operations team has gotten most open terrain into mid-season condition already, pre-season conditions will continue to exist as we work on expanding our offerings. Please ski in control, and be aware of changing terrain. At this time, there is <strong>no beginner terrain</strong> available on the mountain. In addition to this,&nbsp;<strong>no uphill traffic is permitted at this time.</strong> Our team continues to work exceptionally hard to take advantage of the prolonged cold and open additional acreage as quickly as possible.</p><p>It's not too late to secure your <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/season-passes" title="Season Passes | Sunday River">New England Pass</a> or <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/ticket-packs">Maine Ticket Pack</a>. The wait is over for those looking to take advantage of Cyber Monday savings. We kicked off our biggest sale of the year early with up to 30% off lodging, and lift tickets from as low as $55. All the details can be <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/cyber-monday" title="Cyber Monday | Sunday River">found here</a>. Don't wait!
