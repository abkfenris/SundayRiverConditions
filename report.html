<h4><strong>December 27, 2022 | 6:35 AM</strong></h4><h2><strong>Morning Update</strong><span></span></h2><p>It's another classic east coast winter morning here at Sunday River. The fresh air is crisp, and the winds are calm. As the sun rises, temps will begin to go up, and clouds should begin to clear up for a great day of skiing and riding. By the middle of the day, temperatures will top out at around 27 degrees.</p><p>The Mountain Ops team clocked in for the night and got back to it, grooming as much of the 350 acres of open terrain as possible. They tackled a few ungroomed trails, including Rogue Angel, Grand Ave, and Round About. If you were at Barker, you might have been able to check out the whale back world that was Cascades yesterday. The grooming team got to it overnight to smooth out all those humps, creating an impressive base for this morning.</p><p>The snow guns and fans were on at full force last night and will be running for the morning on trails such as Obsession, Snowbound, Heats Off, Tempest, Tourist Trap, and Ridge Run.</p><p>Another great December day full of groomed trails and freshly blown snow. We hope you are all enjoying your week so far, and remember to take advantage of everything we have going on around the resort for<a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/christmas-vacation-weeks"> Christmas week.</a></p><p>&nbsp;See you out there!<br />-Team Snow</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
