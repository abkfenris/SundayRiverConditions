Afternoon Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: April 20, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 1:30 PM</strong></h5><p>Good afternoon from Jordan 8. The clouds stuck around for the day, but that didn't stop plenty of skiers and riders from coming to Jordan Bowl to get in some good old spring laps.<br />The grooming team will be back on the hill tonight, cleaning up our mess. We will have the same trail lineup tomorrow coming off the Jordan 8 Lift. The weather looks a little sunnier tomorrow, allowing for another great day of skiing and riding here in Western Maine.</p><p>Our<a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/season-passes"> New England Pass Spring Sale</a> is still availble until April 30.
