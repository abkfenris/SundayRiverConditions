<h4><strong>March 19, 2023 |6:30 AM</strong><strong></strong></h4><h4><strong style="font-size: 2em;">Morning Report</strong></h4><p>We were pleasantly surprised with a little dusting of fresh snow this morning to add to the fun. We look forward to another day here on the mountain as the groomers get off the hill and lifts begin warming up for the day. The team got onto the trails last night and groomed them smooth. Terrain will start the day smooth and firm but will begin to soften up a little as the day goes on.</p><p>The weather today will stay relatively cool compared to the last week we have had. Temps will range in the 20s, with mostly cloudy skies throughout the day. We are seeing a chance for the wind to pick up later on. Make sure to check the mountain report for any changes in the lifts' status due to wind.</p><p>We hope you can get yourself and a few buddies up to the mountains soon to enjoy great skiing, and plenty of open terrain. Planning on getting a season pass next year?&nbsp; Want to take advantage of all the snow we currently have? All <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/season-passes">2023-2024 season passes</a> purchased this spring are eligible for use this season starting tomorrow March 20th!&nbsp;</p><p>See you out there!<br />-Team Snow</p><p>Friendly Reminder:<br />We love that our guests are exploring new terrain while enjoying the beautiful views and spectacular homes on Merrill Hill and The Glades. With that in mind, we ask that all guests be respectful of the private property directly adjacent to groomed surfaces by avoiding venturing off trail and staying within the boundary lines of the resort.
