From Jordan to Locke, the trails are already in mid-season form. It's a wonderful time of year to visit Western Maine.</p><p>Looking ahead, our snowmakers will continue their push through tonight, taking advantage of yet another night of terrific temperatures. Expansion is imminent, and we can't wait to continue to open more terrain.&nbsp;</p><p>Please be aware that there is no terrain connecting Jordan Bowl and Locke Mountain and you will need to pick your peak. With the ongoing Barker 6 construction, parking will be very limited at Barker. We recommend heading to South Ridge to park and catching the shuttle over for Locke access.&nbsp;</p><p>Lastly, there are only two days left in our <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/cyber-sale" title="Cyber Sale | Sunday River, Maine">Cyber Sale,</a> with deep discounts on lodging, lift tickets, ticket packs, and other deals.
