<h4><strong>December 29, 2022 | 12:45</strong></h4><h2><strong>Afternoon Update</strong><span></span></h2><p>The mild temps and calm winds made for a great day of skiing and riding out there today. Groomed trails everywhere, and freshly made whalebacks of snow covered the rest. The snowmaking team will be getting a well-deserved day off tonight to let them catch up on rest and allow the Snowcats to push around all the piles they have created for us. The Snowcats will get on the hill as soon as they can tonight to move all this newly made snow and groom out that perfect corduroy on the rest of the mountain.</p><p>The weather tomorrow looks to be on the warmer side for December. Temps will range from 25 to 40 degrees by the middle of the day. Winds seem almost nonexistent tomorrow; however, some clouds may hang around for the day.</p><p>There is still a lot going on here at Sunday river for <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/christmas-vacation-weeks">Christmas week</a>, including a<a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/december-magic-show"> Magic Show</a> tonight at the Grand Summit Hotel and<a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/winter-activities/night-skiing"> Twilight skiing</a> until 6:30.<br />We hope you enjoy the rest of your holiday and have decided to end the year with us here at Sunday River.</p><p>See you on the hill!<br />-Team Snow</p><p><b>UPDATED Uphill Policy</b><span>: Uphill travel is NOT</span><span>&nbsp;permitted until further notice.&nbsp;</span></p><p></p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
