<h4><strong>January 5, 2023 | 2:25 PM</strong></h4><h2><strong>Afternoon Update</strong><span></span></h2><p>It's starting to feel like the beginning of January, as temps remained just below freezing for the day. Mother nature teased us with a slight dusting of fresh snow this morning and kept it cold enough for us to make snow ourselves. Conditions varied from peak to peak.</p><p>These colder temperatures are sticking around and will allow us to make snow all over to fill in problem areas and prepare for more trails to open soon. Our snowcats will get out there to push this freshly fallen and made snow around, break up any possible top layer crust, and groom in those stripes for another day of skiing and riding tomorrow. Let's hope this incoming weather is what we all are wishing for. If mother nature can't provide, our Snow Making team will have to do it themselves. We are constantly striving to bring you the best skiing product we can, and we will do whatever we can to provide that.</p><p>If you are looking into visiting Sunday River, we are offering <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/resort-lodging">one-night stays</a> at the Snow Cap Inn and Grand Summit hotel this weekend.
