Afternoon Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: January 16, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 3:52 PM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>It's snowing, and it's snowing hard. We've gotten nearly 3" at the higher peaks already, with the potential for another 3-6" to fall throughout the evening. Our base is built thanks to 27" of snow over the past 10 days, and we're ready for some powder.&nbsp;</p><p>For this evening, the snowmaking team will be hard at work, taking advantage of every second of cold temps. White Cap is currently under the guns, with hopes to have more trails opening on that peak by the weekend.&nbsp;</p><p>The grooming team will be back on their regularly scheduled trails, while continuing to resurface and build additional terrain. No matter which way you like to ski, it's shaping up to be an incredible weekend.</p><p>Have you always wished you could ride in a snow cat?
