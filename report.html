Afternoon Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: January 22, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 1:30 PM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>Another sweet day on the slopes of Western Maine. Although we did have some wind as you crested the summits, it wasn't strong enough to interrupt our lift operations. The temps definitely did what they were supposed to, but we got a nice dash of sun through the mid-morning into the early afternoon that was a welcomed surprise. Overall, conditions were pretty great, so major kudos to all of our operations teams for doing such a phenomenal job.</p><p>Speaking of Ops, our snowmakers also fired up the system over on White Heat! It's called the "Pig" for a reason, so it's going to take a bit of time to get it ready to open, but rest assured our snowmakers are working tirelessly to get everything opened up as quickly as possible.&nbsp;</p><p>This coming week is Senior Week, and we have a whole list of events, including a Cinabun Social, musical bingo, a comedy show, and karaoke. Find all of the details on our <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/senior-week" title="Senor Week | Sunday River, Maine">Senior Week</a> event page.
