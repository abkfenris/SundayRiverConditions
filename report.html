<h5>December 13, 2021</h5><p>Blue skies and freshly groomed trails, today is a beautiful time to be here on the most open terrain in the East! We are constantly adding to our long list of almost 50 groomed trails, so look forward to even more corduroy terrain to carve tomorrow. Snowmakers are blasting guns all night and into tomorrow to create piles and piles of snow. Come ring in the holidays with us at Winterfest this weekend, we have activities aplenty for family and friends including fireworks and live music. This Saturday, December 18, twilight skiing will be opening with tickets at $10 for all ages! Barker, South Ridge, the Chondola, Spruce, and White Cap Quad lifts are all spinning from 9AM-3:45PM tomorrow.</p><p>Jordan Bowl is opening by next weekend, at which point both hotels will feature ski-in/ski-out trails for your convenience. Please note that our only beginner terrain is available within the South Ridge Express Quad at this time. With this in mind, skiing into the Grand Summit Hotel is currently accessible via blue terrain. Although the White Cap Lodge and Grand Summit Hotel are now ski-in/ski-out, all skier services including shopping and guest service are temporarily concentrated to Barker and South Ridge Lodges. Come enjoy our abundant selection of skiable terrain!</p><p><strong>Around the Resort</strong></p><p>Join us at <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/winterfest-weekend.xml" title="winterfest weekend">Winterfest Weekend</a> for some holiday cheer!
