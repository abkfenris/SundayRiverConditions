Afternoon Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: November 20, 2023 </strong></em><strong>| 1:35 PM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>We were treated to another beautiful day in Western Maine! Hopefully by now you're getting your sea legs back and are ready for some more. Heading into tomorrow, Rogue is scheduled to reopen with head-to-toe grooming, so it should be mint. Lollapalooza will also receive it's nightly touch-up, courtesty of the grooming team. The snowmaking team is also going full steam with the current temps and our eyes are set on expansion. No firm timeline of when more terrain will start opening up, but the teams are working hard to make it happen.</p><p>For those needing ticket assistance, a Guest Service station is located in the bottom terminal of the Jordan 8. All Ikon Pass holders who need assistance must visit the Welcome Center in the South Ridge Base Lodge. Additionally, from now until December 1, all rentals for Type 2 skiers and above, can be made, in person only, at the Sunday River Rental Shop. The equipment rental shop is located in the tunnel at the South Ridge base area.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Please note that early-season, variable terrain will be present on all trails. Lastly, don't forget to check out our <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/early-season" title="Early Season Guide | Sunday River, Maine">Early Season Guide</a>.</p><p><span>Locke Mountain will continue to serve as the resort's dedicated early-season training venue for our partners Gould Academy and Bates College, as well as for pre-booked ski teams only. All public access to snow surfaces will be through the Jordan Bowl.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Please note that as crews work to expand the resort, all uphill travel is prohibited. The current <a href="/mountain-report#uphill_status">Uphill Route Status</a> can be found at the bottom of the Mountain Report. Also, all construction areas remain off-limits. Thank you in advance for allowing our crews the space to safely expand our terrain and complete the last steps of exciting new projects.</span></p><p>As always, keep an eye here for the latest info on our lift and trail status, as well as any other operational updates.</p><p>Think cold!</p><p>- Team Snow</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
