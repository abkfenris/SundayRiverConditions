<h4><strong>December 25, 2022 | 6:28 AM</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></h4><h2><strong>Morning Update</strong><span></span></h2><p>Merry Christmas and happy holidays to all of our skiers and riders; we've got another great on on tap today. If yesterday's motto was "better than expected", then today should just be excellent. Temps stayed in the single digits overnight, which gave our snowmaking team a chance to make some more of that high quality snow you've come to know and love. You can expect some snowmaking to be happening throughout the day, so be aware of that. Our grooming team also hit the hill in full force to work on restoring our snowpack to its former pre-Friday glory. And, wait for it...Monday Mourning and T2 are clear of events and are open to the public! All in all, things are looking pretty good.</p><p>Weather is looking relatively stable, but cold today. We're expecting single digits in the early morning and touching the teens or low 20's in the afternoon, so grab those handwarmers, toss on an extra layer, and make lots of turns to stay warm.</p><p>We'll see you out there, and happy holidays from all of us here at Sunday River.</p><p>-Team Snow</p><p>&nbsp;</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
