<p><strong>February 6, 2022</strong></p><p>Another bluebird in the books! Ski any trail this afternoon since all of our terrain is now 100% open. Choose from 135 stunning glades and trails covered in 18&rdquo; of powder from the recent storm. This morning we enjoyed fresh corduroy made from almost 3 feet of snow we received in the past week. Groomers are putting down stripes tonight on trails including White Heat, Vortex, and 3D.
