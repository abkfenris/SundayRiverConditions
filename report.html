Afternoon Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: January 28, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 1:25 PM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>With comfortable temps, little wind, and soft turns, today was a great way to end the weekend. We had 822 acres of skiable terrain, 18 lifts, and corduroy for days. With a chance of flurries and a bit of sun, tomorrow should be just as good.</p><p>Temps are dropping tonight, and our snowmaking team is jumping right on it. They'll be making snow on some new terrain, as well as resurfacing some current terrain. Our grooming team will be out there as well, and tomorrow we can expect stripes on a lineup of trails similar to today. Our parks team will continue working to build and open more features across the mountain.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/pride-weekend" title="Pride Weekend | Sunday River, Maine">Pride Weekend</a> is next weekend, and <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/presidents-week" title="Presidents' Week | Sunday River, Maine">Presidents' Week</a> is right around the corner.
