<h4><strong>January 19, 2023 | 2:00 PM</strong></h4><h2><strong>Afternoon Report</strong><span></span></h2><p>Overcast skies blocked the sun from really softening up the snow today. Conditions remained firm and fast, but edges gripped the surface with ease. Weather was relatively mild, and the wind calmed just as lifts began to open. Snow guns made fresh snow on closed terrain for most of the day, and 13 lifts remained spinning all day.</p><p>Our team is prepared for a busy night ahead as we look at the future forecast. Snow guns will continue to make snow, and more will go online as soon as temps allow, in preparation for the next few days. Our groomers will hit the mountain fairly early, grooming more advanced terrain and leaving the beginner trails until morning. We are expecting a good amount of snowfall tonight and all day tomorrow. This snow will make a great layer on the freshly groomed trails and pack down nicely in the morning on the beginner terrain.</p><p>We are constantly working to open more trails, and this fresh snow, cold temps, and fantastic snowmaking will allow us to do just that in the upcoming days. Snow will continue to fall and accumulate into the day tomorrow, so please drive safely wherever you may be headed. Let's hope the winds can put this upcoming storm right above us and bless our eight peaks with a much-needed blanket of fresh snow.</p><p>We will see you on the mountain!</p><p>-Team Snow</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
