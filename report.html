<p><strong>November 19, 2022 | 6:44 AM</strong></p><p>Good morning skiers and riders! We're kicking off our first weekend of operation with expanded terrain. Barker Mountain Express will be spinning from 8 AM until 4 PM with skiing off of Right Stuff, Jungle Road, and Ecstasy. While the snow has made for some amazing skiing, early season conditions do exist and snowmaking will be happening throughout the day on Lower Sunday Punch and Right Stuff. T2, Upper Sunday Punch, and Ecstasy will not have active snowmaking today.</p><p>The Locke Mountain Triple is also spinning today but there will be&nbsp;<strong>no midstation loading</strong>.</p><p>Pre-season conditions will continue to exist as we work on expanding our offerings. Please ski in control, and be aware of changing terrain. At this time, there is <strong>no beginner terrain</strong> available on the mountain. In addition to this,&nbsp;<strong>no uphill traffic is permitted at this time.</strong> Our team continues to work exceptionally hard to take advantage of the prolonged cold and open additional acreage as quickly as possible.</p><p>It's not too late to secure your <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/season-passes" title="Season Passes | Sunday River">New England Pass</a> or <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/ticket-packs">Maine Ticket Pack</a>.
