Morning Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: March 5, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 7:40 AM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>Happy Tuesday my fellow winter enthusiasts. This morning is starting off a little interesting, with mild temps and low clouds. Visibility is fairly limited to start off the morning, let&rsquo;s hope the sun can try its best to burn off some of this morning fog.</p><p>Snow making remained on hold last night due to high temps but our groomers were able to get out on the slopes all night into morning and lay tracks throughout most of the mountain. Trails groomed earlier in the night may start the day off a little firm compared to other trails that got a nice once over first thing this morning. If you are out on the mountain today be sure to be a little extra cautious while skiing any trails for your first time of the day. The moisture, sporadic sunlight, and rapid changing temps in the last few days has created variable conditions throughout the resort.&nbsp; As the day moves on our snow surface should begin to soften up allowing for some solid skiing and riding all over our 8 peaks.</p><p><span>As always, check out the <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events">events calendar</a> for the lineup of activities and performances throughout the rest of the month.
