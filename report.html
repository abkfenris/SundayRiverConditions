Tomorrow there are gusty winds forecasted for the day, which may result in wind holds on many of our higher elevation lifts. Please take a look at the report in the morning for lift status updates before heading to the mountain. Tonight, groomers will head out to the slopes to press stripes in the snow for tomorrow and also leave trails untouched with fun bumps.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: #333333;">Looking ahead, we have sunshine on the schedule early this week followed by the potential for snow flurries mid-week. Lifts will start spinning at 9AM.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline;"><span color="#333333" style="color: #333333;">Please note that due to tomorrow's weather, uphill traffic will not be permitted.&nbsp;</span></p><div><p>With operations open daily through April 24, there is plenty of ski season ahead.
