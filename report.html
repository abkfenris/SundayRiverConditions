<p><strong>February 15, 2022</strong></p><p>It's a beautiful day to bundle up and hit the slopes! Cooler temperatures have brought ideal conditions for snowmaking, and we couldn't be more excited. Snowmakers blasted guns yesterday on Right Stuff, T72, Cascades, and Ecstasy so you can take powdery turns this morning. Today fresh flakes are being made on T72, Sunday Punch, Cascades, and Ecstasy. Enjoy an all-natural Right Stuff, or carve into corduroy terrain on more than 70 trails. We are starting today with well over 100 trail options for you to choose, spanning across 855 sunshine-filled acres. Due to frosty temperatures rolling in, winds may impact lifts today. Please keep an eye on the lift and trails status as we keep you updated. Take your Tuesday turns on freshly made snow, under sunny blue skies!</p><p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline;">Little White Cap Quad will be closed for maintenance today. Please note at this time the Grand Summit Hotel is not accessible via beginner trails. All ski-in/out access to the Grand Summit Hotel temporarily requires navigation of intermediate and more advanced terrain.</p><p><strong>Around the Resort</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/presidents-week.xml" title="event listing">Presidents' Week</a> festivities start this weekend!
