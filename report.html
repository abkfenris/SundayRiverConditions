Today was filled with soft snow, sunshine, and blue sky. Spring skiing is in full swing here at Sunday River and it is fantastic. Mornings start off with buttery corduroy and the afternoons are nothing but soft snow and fun bumps. Leave work early and come soak up the sunshine until last chair. Tonight the groomers are going to hit the trails to smooth out the snow for another beautiful day tomorrow. Set your alarm and hop on first chair at 9AM.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p><p><a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/resort-lodging">One-night stays are now available</a> Saturday at the Grand Summit and Jordan Hotel, so plan a quick springtime getaway for a weekend of skiing in the sunshine.&nbsp;</p><div><p>With operations open daily through April 24, there is plenty of ski season ahead.
