</h6><p style="color: #696969; font-weight: 900; font-size: 12px;">SATURDAY, JANUARY 9</p><p>Thanks to all the hard work from our Mountain Operations Team, we kicked off the weekend with terrain expansion and great conditions. The Little White Cap Quad started spinning today for the first time this season, opening up terrain on Moonstruck, Green Cheese, and Starlight. T72 and Airglow also made their debut today. Our snowmakers are still hard at work and will be making snow through the night on trails like White Heat, Cowardly Lion, Lost Princess, Lower Vortex, and Paradigm. Groomers will hit the slopes and press stripes on all open terrain for tomorrow's turns. Ski or ride until 6:30PM tonight with <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/winter-activities/night-skiing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">twilight skiing</a> out of South Ridge and enjoy firedancer shows at 6:15PM and 6:45PM, followed by our weekly fireworks at 7PM.&nbsp;</p><p>Looking ahead, we're pushing to add even more terrain for the three-day Martin Luther King Jr. weekend and offering <a href="/special-deals/mlk-lodging" title="MLK lodging sale">20% off resort lodging</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">Lifts will start spinning at 8AM tomorrow. Both of our resort hotels are ski-in/ski-out and with opening of the Little White Cap Quad, the Grand Summit Hotel will now have beginner terrain access.&nbsp;</span></p><p>All three base areas lodges are open with full services at South Ridge including season pass pickup, shopping, and rentals. There are several additional&nbsp;<a style="font-style: inherit;" href="https://www.sundayriver.com/river-guide"><strong>dining options</strong></a>&nbsp;around the resort, but please keep in mind that capacity is limited.</p><p><strong>Lift ticket pick up</strong>: Fast and contactless ticket pickup is available at our PUBs (Pick Up Boxes) throughout the resort. Just scan the barcode at the bottom of your confirmation email and your RFID cards will print with your lift tickets or ticket packs loaded. Don't forget to turn off dark mode on your phone if you use it.&nbsp;</p><p>As we continue to adjust resort operations to prioritize the safety of our guests, we are now&nbsp;<a title="Online Store" href="https://shop.sundayriver.com/s/lift-tickets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>requiring online lift ticket purchase</strong></a> or reloading and setting <strong>limits on the number of tickets sold</strong> for each day. This includes day, half-day, beginner, Threedom additional days, and Passholder Friend tickets. We only expect these limits to come into play on peak dates, but encourage everyone to buy early to ensure access on the dates you want. Season passes, Ikon passes, and lift ticket packs remain direct-to-lift with no restrictions or reservations.</p><p>Lastly, please remember to check our <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/covid">COVID Winter Guide</a> before each visit to make a plan for your day and stay on top of any potential changes. We&rsquo;re in this together and need your help.</p><p>See you tomorrow!</p><p>- Team Snow</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
