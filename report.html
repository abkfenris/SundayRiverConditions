<p><strong>November 29, 2022 | 7:35 AM</strong></p><p>Good morning, and welcome to another beautiful day here in Western Maine. The Sunday River snow globe is in full effect, as our snowmakers are literally making weather happen. It's pretty darn cool to see if you ask us. The groomers worked their magic across Locke, Barker, and Spruce last night. With cooling temps following the warm spell, we're happy to report that all groomed terrain is skiing wonderfully. As we work to take advantage of every cold snap, please note that there will be active snowmaking across all open terrain on Locke, Spruce, and South Ridge today.&nbsp;</p><p>Time is running out to take advantage of our huge Cyber Week savings. Head over to our <a href="/cyber-monday" title="Cyber Monday">Cyber Monday</a> page and snag some deals on lift tickets and lodging. The sale disappears on Wednesday, so don't wait!</p><p>&nbsp;- Team Snow</p><p></p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
