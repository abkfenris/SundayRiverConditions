<h4><strong>April 17, 2023 | 7:28 AM</strong><strong></strong></h4><h4><strong style="font-size: 2em;">Morning Report</strong></h4><p>Good morning everybody! Hopefully you didn't party too hard during yesterday's Barker send-off and are able to grab a few turns today. You know the old saying, "April showers bring May flowers" but frankly, snow quality while skiing with a bit of rain is usually pretty darn good and that's what we expect for today. It's still warm so the snow will be soft and creamy, perfect spring turns!&nbsp;</p><p>Today we are spinning the Chondola and Spruce from 9am-4pm. The Chondola is more of an access point to Spruce, and while you're more than welcome to lap the Chondi, the better skiing is up on Spruce. Please also note that there is <strong>no access into Barker basin </strong>and we currently have<strong> no beginner terrain</strong>. The mountain will be closed Tuesday-Friday while we re-group for one more hurrah. Uphill access will be closed from Tuesday-Friday. We have a big summer of upgrades planned, which means lots of heavy machinery moving around the mountain.&nbsp;</p><p>We'll see you out there!</p><p>-Team Snow</p><p></p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
