<h5>January 29, 2022</h5><p>What is better than a snowy Saturday? An entire weekend full of fresh powder! The forecast is setting us up for piles and piles of snow starting today and going well into tonight, with totals reaching up to a foot or more. As with most Nor'easters, we are anticipating winds rolling in later this afternoon. We won't know if that will have an impact on our lifts until later. We'll keep you updated in the lift status if anything changes.</p><p>Groomers put corduroy across 80 trails last night, making a great base for all this fresh snow. We are dancing in our ski boots with excitement as we catch first chair at 8AM. Ski all day with <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/winter-activities/night-skiing.xml" title="Twilight Skiing">Twilight Skiing</a> lifts spinning until 6:30PM. We are starting today with over 100 open trails, and more in sight as Mother Nature covers all 8 peaks. Gear up for a great weekend.</p><p>Please note that ski-in access to the Jordan Hotel requires the navigation of intermediate trails to reach Jordan Bowl.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Around the Resort</strong><o:p></o:p><a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/wicked-air-and-apres"></a></p><p>The <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/winter-activities/apres-aglow.xml" title="Apres Aglow">Apr&egrave;s Aglow </a>lighted walk is open tonight, so come enjoy thousands of twinkling lights in a winter wonderland, while sipping on hot cocoa.</p><p>For the latest updates on available shopping, dining, and activities whenever you visit us, head to the <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/river-guide" target="_blank" title="river guide" rel="noopener">River Guide</a>.<o:p></o:p></p><p>-Team Snow<o:p></o:p></p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
