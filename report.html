LIFT TICKETS ARE SOLD OUT FOR TODAY</h6><p style="color: #696969; font-weight: 900; font-size: 12px;">SUNDAY, JANUARY 17</p><p>8AM Update: Jordan Bowl Express and Barker Mountain Express are currently on hold. North Peak Express will have a delayed opening.&nbsp;</p><p>Yesterday we were very lucky with a storm that brought us 6-9&rdquo; of new snow with very little mixing. Skiers and riders enjoyed free refills all day on the slopes. Today you can look for fresh stashes and perfectly pressed corduroy on all eight peaks. The Oz Quad lift opened for the first time of the season yesterday, and conditions were fantastic up there. Head to the mountain early today and enjoy a little bit of everything on the slopes. If you are a beginner, South Ridge has the best learning area or there are great green trails on White Cap off of Little White Cap Quad if you're staying at the Grand Summit Hotel.</p><p>Lifts start spinning at 8AM today. Mother Nature was good to us yesterday, but today she is sending some wind as the tail end of the storm sweeps through. Please continue to check lift status updates, as some of our higher elevation lifts could go on hold if the wind picks up today. In preparation, our team has removed the cabins off of the Chondola to give us a better chance of avoiding a wind hold.</p><p>If you're looking for a last-minute getaway, we still have resort lodging available tonight. As an added bonus,&nbsp;<strong style="font-style: inherit;">all lodging guests are guaranteed lift ticket access, even when we are sold out like we are today.</strong>&nbsp;Please note that we are experiencing high call volume in our call center and guest services, so we recommend using our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/booklodging" style="font-style: inherit;"><strong>online booking engine</strong></a>&nbsp;for lodging reservations or quotes. Both of our resort hotels are ski-in/ski-out with access to beginner terrain.</p><p>There are plenty of food options around the resort for spreading out, but please remember that capacity is limited. Take a look at the <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/river-guide">River Guide</a> to discover locations, hours, online ordering, and how to make a reservation. For any needs such as season pass pickup, shopping, tuning, rentals, and SnowSports School, head to South Ridge Lodge.</p><p>For the safety of our team members and guests, we are&nbsp;<a title="Online Store" href="https://shop.sundayriver.com/s/lift-tickets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>requiring online lift ticket purchases</strong></a>&nbsp;and setting <strong>limits on the number of tickets sold</strong> for each day. This includes day, half-day, beginner, Threedom additional days, and Passholder Friend tickets. We only expect these limits to come into play on peak dates, but encourage everyone to buy early to ensure access on the dates you want. Season passes, Ikon passes, and lift ticket packs remain direct-to-lift with no restrictions or reservations.</p><p>Fast and contactless lift ticket pickup is available at our PUBs (Pick Up Boxes) throughout the resort. Just scan the barcode at the bottom of your confirmation email and your RFID cards will print with your lift tickets or ticket packs loaded. For best results turn off dark mode on your phone if you use it and avoid email apps that use dark backgrounds.</p><p>Before each trip to the slopes, make sure you visit our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/covid">COVID Winter Guide</a>&nbsp;to make a plan for your visit and stay on top of any potential changes.&nbsp;</p><p>See you on the slopes!</p><p>- Team Snow</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
