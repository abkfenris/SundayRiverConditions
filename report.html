<h5>January 30, 2022</h5><p>Spend your Sunday on the slopes with 12-14&rdquo; of new snow! Mother Nature delivered over a foot of powder on nearly 700 acres of open terrain. Groomers put down stripes throughout the night to make beautiful corduroy for you this morning. As this snowy system moves out of town, please keep in mind winds will temporarily impact our lifts this morning. We will keep you updated on our lift and trail status as the wind calms throughout the day. Ski piles and piles of snow for miles and miles!</p><p>Please note that ski-in access to the Jordan Hotel requires the navigation of intermediate trails to reach Jordan Bowl.</p><p><strong>Around the Resort</strong><o:p></o:p><a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/wicked-air-and-apres"></a></p><p>For the latest updates on available shopping, dining, and activities whenever you visit us, head to the <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/river-guide" target="_blank" title="river guide" rel="noopener">River Guide</a>.<o:p></o:p></p><p>-Team Snow</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
