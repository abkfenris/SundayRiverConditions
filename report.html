Yes, you read that right, our team will be firing up the snow guns tonight on White Heat, Right Stuff, and Sunday Punch. Groomers will head out tonight on their normal routes, pressing perfect stripes for more fast carving tomorrow. While we wait for the sweet sound of snowmaking, keep enjoying the sunshine and ski or ride up until 6:30PM with twilight skiing out of South Ridge. Stick around until 7PM and end your night on the slopes with a fireworks show. Please note that the Chondola cabins have been removed for the weekend due to the anticipation of wind.&nbsp;</p><p><span>The <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/season-passes" title="Season Passes">2021-22 New England Pass is back on sale</a>, granting access to Sunday River, Loon &amp; Sugarloaf all next year.
