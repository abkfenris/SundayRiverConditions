Afternoon Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: January 12, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 1:51 PM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>By this afternoon, we had blue skies comfortable temps, and over 350 acres of open terrain. The fun doesn't stop here, though; a system is moving in tonight through tomorrow morning, and we're expecting 5-10" of snow. There are currently higher winds forecasted for tomorrow morning which may impact operations, so make sure to check the mountain report before hitting the slopes.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to half a foot of fresh snow, our snowmaking team will run our snowmaking system aggressively across the mountain, with a focus on Merrill Hill and T72. Keep an eye out for new terrain in the coming week. Our grooming team is planning on hitting our current list of groomed terrain, with the addition of Lower Downdraft, Grand Rapids, and Upper Airglow. Who Ville also opened today with 16 features.&nbsp;</p><p>This weekend is <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/mlk-weekend" title="MLK Weekend | Sunday River, Maine">Martin Luther King Jr. Weekend</a>, and we have fun for the whole family.
