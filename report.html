<h4><strong>January 22, 2023 | 6:30 AM</strong></h4><h2><strong>Morning Report</strong><span></span></h2><p>Are you ready for another great day of skiing and riding here at Sunday River? The mountain is getting ready for the day as we prepare to open our lifts and share over 700 acres of open terrain with you on this beautiful Sunday morning.</p><p>The weather today is shaping up to be quite pleasant. Temps will range from the low 20s at first chair to the low 30s by the middle of the day. Partial cloud coverage is forecasted, but hopefully, the sun will be able to peak through every now and then as clouds pass by. Winds should remain calm and visibility will be great for a day on the slopes.</p><p>The Mountain Ops team quickly got busy last night, turning on snow guns and grooming trails all over the resort. Over 200 snow guns were on throughout the night and will remain on until we lose cold temperatures in the middle of the day. The groomers got to their usual trails and could even get to Salvation and Vortex to smooth those out and lay down that perfect corduroy.</p><p>Tomorrow is the beginning of <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/senior-week">Senior Week</a>, where senior skiers and riders can take advantage of discounts, deals, and activities throughout the week. We hope you can make it up to the heart of western Maine soon, as the upcoming weather is starting to look very promising.</p><p>&nbsp;See you out there!<br />-Team Snow</p><p>&nbsp;</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
