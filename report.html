<h4><strong>February 9, 2023 | 2:30 PM</strong></h4><h4><strong style="font-size: 2em;">Afternoon Report</strong></h4><p>Warmer temps and mild winds created a great day of skiing and riding out there. Our groomed trails gripped the edge of your skis as you carved into the mountain. As the day went on, the woods runs began to soften up, and those technical areas also began to ski quite well.</p><p>Looking ahead, we are seeing reports of precipitation starting this afternoon. It's hard to tell what form of precipitation will fall and will most likely vary throughout the area. We are going into the night with temperatures at the base right around 35 degrees, so we will have to wait until morning to see what Mother Nature has left us.</p><p>This being said, our grooming team will get out onto the trails right after the last chair to groom out as much as possible before anything begins to fall from the sky. They will leave a few of the usually groomed runs untouched to preserve snowpack and snow quality. Steeper trails such as Airglow, Vortex, Right Stuff, Upper Risky Bussiness, Wildfire, Obsession, and 3D will not be groomed tonight. Keep an eye on the snow report in the morning, as this may change early in the morning tomorrow if trail conditions deem it necessary. Tomorrow will bring partly cloudy skies, gusty winds on and off throughout the day, and temps ranging in the mid-high 30s.</p><p>&nbsp;See you out there!<br />-Team Snow</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
