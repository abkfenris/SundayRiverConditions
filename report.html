<h5>January 16, 2022</h5><p>Sunshine, blue skies, and double-digit temperatures by the afternoon make for Sunday Funday on the slopes this long weekend. Grab first chair at 8AM to enjoy fresh corduroy from White Heat to Lollapalooza. Trust us, you won't want to miss this corker of a day on the mountain. Shimmy into an extra layer or two, slap on some SPF, and cruise on 75 groomed trails and 469 acres of skiable terrain. Please note that ski-in access to the Jordan Hotel requires the navigation of intermediate trails to reach Jordan Bowl.&nbsp;</p><p>Now, tomorrow is going to look a lot different. <strong>We don't want to jinx it, but there's a foot of snow in the forecast</strong>.
