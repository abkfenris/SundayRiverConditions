<h4><strong>December 23, 2022 | 3:38 PM</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></h4><h2><strong>Afternoon Update</strong></h2><p>Well, we gave it the ol' college try. It definitely wasn't a beautiful day on the slopes by any means, but all credit goes to our entire operations team for keeping lifts spinning throughout the day.</p><p>The saving grace of this storm was the 4-6" of new snow that accumulated before the changeover to rain. This layer of snow acts as a protective layer over our existing base, soaking up the rain that we've gotten throughout the day, and providing the groomers with a layer of frozen precipitation to work with. The importance of this cannot be understated, and will dramatically improve the work that our grooming team will be able to accomplish this evening.</p><p>Speaking of the grooming team, here's what they'll be up to. The cats will stay parked until roughly midnight, which will allow temps to crash, and the surface layer of our base to freeze. Once this happens, it will be all hands on deck, with machines working throughout the night to churn up the top layer and press out the perfect corduroy you've come to expect. Timing is everything with an operation like this, as starting too early will simply result in the groomers work refreezing into a solid surface.</p><p>Another silver lining to this storm is the bitter cold that will be drawn in behind it. This will provide our snowmakers with the ideal conditions to get our snowmaking system fired up. This means 10,000+ gallons per minute will be pumping across the mountain as soon as possible, with initial efforts focusing on resurfacing. Once sufficient snow has been made, we'll re-direct efforts into expansion mode, with the goal of opening additional terrain as soon as possible.&nbsp;</p><p>There's no real way around it. Even with the world-class team, top-of-the-line equipment, and planning that we have in place, tomorrow will be a challenging day. As I sit here writing this report at 3:15 PM on Friday, the word is that we are not expecting any delayed openings. However, waiting on information to come in in the early hours tomorrow will be paramount to our communication efforts in the morning, as these plans can, and will, change depending on what our operators find on the hill. Rest assured, every one of us here at Sunday River is committed to turning these lemons into lemonade, and making sure that our conditions for the holiday week are the best in New England.&nbsp;</p><p>As always, keep your eyes on the mountain report for all of the most up-to-date information on the conditions outside, and we'll talk to you tomorrow morning.</p><p>-Team Snow</p><p>&nbsp;</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
