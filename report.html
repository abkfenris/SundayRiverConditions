It's a chilly but beautiful day out there with the sun shining and over 700 acres to ski and ride on. Ropes have been dropping left and right over the past week and today we added Poppy Fields to the list. Groomers will head out overnight to press the perfect stripes for tomorrow's turns. We're looking at a perfect ski day tomorrow with warmer temps and sunny skies, so take advantage and hop on first chair at 8AM to start making your way across all eight peaks. Keep it up out there until 6:30PM tonight with twilight skiing out of South Ridge and end your night on the slopes with a fireworks show at 7PM.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>This winter, your car is your base lodge.
