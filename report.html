Due to yesterday&rsquo;s taste of spring, followed by an overnight temperature swing, we're sending our grooming team out for another lap. There will be delayed openings on several lifts as they work to tidy things up and with the addition of significant winds, we anticipate to have limited terrain today. Please continue to check in on lift status updates throughout the day as our team continues to assess wind as well as open up terrain after the snow cats are off the slopes. Uphill access is not permitted today.</p><p><span>The <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/season-passes" title="Season Passes">2021-22 New England Pass is back on sale</a>, granting access to Sunday River, Loon &amp; Sugarloaf all next year.
