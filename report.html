<h4><strong>March 17, 2023 | 2:30</strong><strong></strong></h4><h4><strong style="font-size: 2em;">Afternoon Report</strong></h4><p>Although clouds stuck around and it wasn't the brightest day, the forecasted precipitation has held off until after the last chair. The thick clouds kept temps down, and snow conditions firm for the most part, but trails became softer as the snow was skied up and temperatures began to rise by mid-day. As we prepare the mountain for another great weekend, our team will get onto the hill tonight to erase our tracks and smooth out the moguls. Perfectly drawn corduroy stripes will be laid down onto most of our terrain, ready to be torn up by our guests in the morning.</p><p>The forecast looks promising for the weekend as temps will remain in the mid-20s to mid-30s during lift hours, and the sun should be shining bright. What's not to love about comfortable temps and over 800 acres of beautiful snow-covered trails to ski and ride?
