<p><strong>April 14, 2022</strong></p><p>Good morning Sunday River skiers and riders! Look - I'm not going to lie to you. It's not a bluebird day out there today. I can't say the sun is shining. Despite this less than perfect weather, we're gearing up for a great day on the slopes. Our grooming team just got off the mountain, so the corduroy is a fresh-pressed as it gets out there. We've still got almost 200 acres of open terrain for you to explore! Skiing with us today? Break out the Gore-Tex and pack an extra pair of socks - you'll thank me later. Remember, you're not hardcore unless you live hardcore. Today's a day for the hardcore skiers. Check out the best ways to get in your runs with our weekly updates on the <a href="/spring" title="Spring Schedule">Spring Schedule</a>.
