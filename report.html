<h5>January 5, 2022</h5><p>This morning we enjoyed corduroy on Tempest, and freshly made snow on American Express and Upper Sunday Punch. Groomers are working all tonight to put stripes across 8 peaks. Tomorrow, we will have nearly 400 acres of terrain for you to ski. All scheduled lifts will be spinning from 9:00AM to 3:45PM tomorrow, as well as today incase you'd like to take some afternoon turns. We are looking forward to the weekend as the Friday forecast develops, calling for flurries on the trails. Carve into the most open terrain in the East today!</p><p>Both hotels are now ski-in/ski-out for your convenience. To ski&nbsp; into the Grand Summit Hotel, please take Little White Cap Quad and ski Moonstruck via Green Cheese. When skiing into the Jordan Hotel, beginner terrain is limited to Jordan Peak via Lollapalooza, and skiing in from a different peak is currently considered advanced.</p><p><strong>Around the Resort</strong><o:p></o:p></p><p><a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/special-deals.xml" title="Dash Deals at Sunday River">Dash Deals</a> have hit the slopes this week!
