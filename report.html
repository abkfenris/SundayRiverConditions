Don your Red, White and Blue and head for the hills! The trails are drying nicely, however overnight rains may create some wet patches in areas.&nbsp; Make sure to watch your footing especially as you go downhill.&nbsp;</p><p>All summer trails remain open this weekend, but please use extra caution around the top of the Chondola and as you cross the American Express Ski Trail on the Summit Traverse Hiking Trail.</p><p>If you are looking for an easy way to get out and enjoy the outdoors this holiday weekend, try the Evergreen Trail (D). It is a short out-and-back trail from the Summit Hotel that keeps the elevation low. Adventure seekers might want to try our new Tango (A) hiking trail. This trail winds through the woods and keeps you out of the sun. Combine it with the South Ridge Loop and a ride on the Chondola to make a fun hike!</p><p>There is at least one Momma Bear with cubs roaming the mountain. Please give this family, and all our wildlife, the space to enjoy their beautiful backyard.</p><p>We have many new and exciting projects underway at Sunday River, including of the <a href="/jordan-8" title="Jordan 8">Jordan 8</a>, which means we&rsquo;ve unfortunately had to close hiking access to Spruce, Aurora, Oz, and Jordan peaks. For your safety, please obey signage at all times and remain aware of your surroundings, especially when choosing to walk on roads.</p><p>Some trails may be closed periodically during the summer for construction projects. Please check the weekly Mountain Report for updates and obey all posted signage.</p><p>If you need assistance, get lost, or are injured, don&rsquo;t hesitate to call Patrol at (207)-824-5350. Patrol will be available 7 days a week during normal operating hours.</p><p></p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
