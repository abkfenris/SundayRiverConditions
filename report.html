SOLD OUT OF TICKETS FOR SATURDAY, JANUARY 30</h6><p style="color: #696969; font-weight: 900; font-size: 12px;">THURSDAY, JANUARY 28</p><div><p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="color: #333333;">Yesterday Mother Nature gave us a sweet surprise with 4&rdquo; of new snow. Conditions have been amazing, but they just got even better. With this new snow groomed into the slopes, you can expect incredible carving. Plus, ropes have been dropping left and right so we now have more open glades including Blind Ambition and Celestial. Snowmakers must have the can&rsquo;t stop won&rsquo;t stop motto in their mind because last night they fired up the snow guns on Risky Business, South Paw, Broadway, Who-Ville, Lower Sunday Punch, and Easy Street. It is a wintery paradise on the mountain right now, and you should definitely hop on first chair at 9AM to enjoy it. <o:p></o:p></span></p><p><span>This winter, your car is your base lodge.
