Afternoon Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: December 29, 2023 </strong></em><strong>| 1:58 PM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>We had another day of comfortable temps and soft turns, but the forecast has temps beginning to drop tonight and into tomorrow. Things might be a little firmer out there tomorrow, and there&rsquo;s even a potential for some snow showers until tomorrow morning, so think snow.</p><p>Our grooming team will be laying stripes on all open terrain tonight, and we can expect a similar lineup of trails for tomorrow. While we are still on a snowmaking pause, there&rsquo;s a possibility that temps will cool down enough for snowmaking. If that&rsquo;s the case, our snowmaking team will be out and at it. If temperatures are marginal, then tomorrow night is likely our night, and we'll be ready to blast 10,000 gallons of water per minute across the resort.</p><p>We have twilight skiing tonight off of lift 2, and there&rsquo;s live music with James Rice at the Foggy Goggle from 3-6PM and at Shipyard with Denny Breau from 5-8PM.&nbsp; Check out our <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/apres-and-nightlife" title="Apr&egrave;s and Nightlife | Sunday River, Maine">Apr&egrave;s and Nightlife</a> page for all the details. New Year&rsquo;s Eve&nbsp;is fast approaching, and with it all of our events for the night. We have a kids-only party, a <a href="https://shop.sundayriver.com/s/events/p/foggy-goggle-new-years-eve-party" title="Foggy Goggle New Year's Eve Party | Sunday River, Maine">21+ party</a>, fireworks, and more.

Access will be via the Spruce Peak Triple to Sirius, Aludra, then Light's Out.</p><p>In addition to the Peak Lodge opening, we are planning to open the Chondola this Sunday, December 31. As construction wraps up in South Ridge and snowmaking comes back online, we are expecting to load the gondola cabins only for the first few days.</p><p>Looking ahead, our goal is to be skiing in the Jordan Bowl on Friday, January 5. This will include ski-in, ski-out access to the Jordan Hotel. The Alpeniglu is also scheduled to re-open on Friday, as well as the Outpost, for convenient slopeside snacks and beverages. Snowmaking temps will be crucial to meeting this goal, but the forecast looks promising, and our snowmakers are raring to get back to what they do best.</p><p>Thank you to everyone who has supported Sunday River through this recovery process. We wouldn&rsquo;t be here without everyone who helped.</p><p>We'll see you out there!</p><p>- Team Snow</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
