Morning Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: February 3, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 6:35 AM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>With the Oz Quad set to spin today, Sunday River is officially open across all 8 peaks. We've got 856 acres of open terrain, half of which is groomed for your carving pleasure. With mostly sunny skies and temps in the upper teens to mid-twenties, today should be an excellent day.&nbsp;</p><p>Our grooming team laid corduroy on over half of our open terrain today, including trails like Cowardly Lion, Three Mile Trail, and all of Merrill Hill. Today, White Heat, American Express, Overdraft, and Tourist Trap will remain ungroomed due to snowmaking last night. Our snowmaking team kept adding snow to White Heat, and they also resurfaced American Express and Tourist Trap. Once the guns turn off on White Heat, they'll pivot to Shock Wave.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/pride-weekend" title="Pride Weekend | Sunday River, Maine">Pride Weekend</a> started yesterday, and there are events for everyone to enjoy.
