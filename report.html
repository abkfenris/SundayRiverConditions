<h4><strong>March 28, 2023 | 7:32 AM</strong><strong></strong></h4><h4><strong style="font-size: 2em;">Morning Report</strong></h4><p>Spring is in the air here in Western Maine, and we're pretty excited about it. The last month has brought tons of snow and excellent skiing, which has set us up for an amazing spring thanks to all of this base we've accumulated. Yesterday was a sample of what's to come, with plentiful corn snow to harvest, warm temps, and beautiful blue skies. Yeah, count us in.</p><p>Grooming had another successful night smoothing out 81 trails for your enjoyment. We're staying strong at 883 acres of total terrain, accessed by 13 lifts. The big news for this week is that the South Ridge Express will spin for the rest of the week before closing down for the season. All details on spring operations can be found on our <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/spring">Spring Schedule</a>.</p><p>It may almost be April, but we've still got plenty of amazing skiing and great events coming up to keep you entertained. This weekend is <a href="/events/spring-fest-weekend" title="Spring Fest">Spring Fest</a> over at White Cap. The party starts Friday night and goes through Sunday afternoon, and definitely shouldn't be missed.</p><p>It's going to be an amazing spring, so why not ski or ride <strong>for free</strong>?
