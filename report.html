<h4><strong>February 6, 2023 | 1:31 PM</strong></h4><h4><strong style="font-size: 2em;">Afternoon Report</strong></h4><p>The skiing today did not disappoint. Even though the clouds lingered through most of the morning, the sun poked through, the temps stayed mild, and the snow was the perfect consistency to rip some turns. Our inverted temps from this morning have mostly worked themselves out at this point, which means our snowmakers will be able to get back to wrapping up on those last few trails. We're sitting pretty at just over 800 acres of skiing, which is no small feat given the start of the season that we had.&nbsp;</p><p>As always, keep your eyes on the Mountain Report for any updates and enjoy your turns!</p><p>&nbsp;See you out there!<br />-Team Snow</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
