<h4><strong>December 21, 2022 | 2:00 PM&nbsp;</strong></h4><h2><strong>Afternoon Update</strong></h2><p>As the first chairs were loading and the mountain began to wake up, the sun came out strong and cleared the clouds for the day. The bluebird weather matched perfectly with the crispy, freshly drawn corduroy. Moguls scattered ungroomed terrain, perfect for waking up your legs and working your muscles. Aurora looked wonderful today as people headed west to take advantage of the newly opened terrain and get a peek at the beautiful Jordan 8 in the distance.</p><p>Clouds will roll in tomorrow as temps begin to drop. Winds will be low throughout the day, and snow may start to fall by the end of the lift service in the afternoon. Our team will work through the night to groom out most of the open terrain and blow snow throughout our western peaks to grow open terrain at Aurora and prepare for the opening of Jordan.</p><p>Speaking of Jordan, did you hear? We will officially open the Jordan Bowl and the Jordan 8 to the public on December 26th at 9:30 AM! Join us for the departure of the first chair, thank all the people involved in creating this masterpiece, and celebrate the completion of such an achievement.</p><p>&nbsp;Happy winter solstice, and we will see you out there!<br />-Team Snow</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
