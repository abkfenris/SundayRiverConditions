Trails were groomed out smooth last night, and our team is already on the hill preparing the slopes and lifts for another day of skiing and riding.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">It will be a comfortable temp out there today, ranging in the 30s. Clouds will come and go, but visibility should remain reasonable. It's a little windy this morning as gusts begin to roll through. As our team prepares to open lifts, wind checks will be done, and operators will update us on possible holds this morning. Keep your eyes here for the most up-to-date information throughout the day. If the winds calm down and let our lifts run smoothly, it will be a great day of freshly groomed trails and fun, filled in woods.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">As a reminder,&nbsp;</span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">2023-24 New England Passes</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;hit the shelves.
