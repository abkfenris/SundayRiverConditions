<h4><strong>January 14, 2023 | 1:25 PM</strong></h4><h2><strong>Afternoon Update</strong><span></span></h2><p>The constant snow flurries provided a winter wonderland experience throughout the day. The sun wasn't out, but clouds stayed high, allowing for good visibility and colder temps. The snow stayed firm and grainy&nbsp; for the day. A second grooming tonight will take care of this and make all the difference.</p><p>Our mountain ops team is back to work as usual making snow on currently closed terrain all over the resort. There will be snowmaking on a few open trails through the night also, until temperatures begin to warm up in the morning. Our groomers will hit the mountain tonight in order to move around all this freshly made snow, and groom trails smooth. They plan to hit as much of the resort as possible, if not all, to ensure a quality product for skiing and riding tomorrow.</p><p>Keep an eye on the Mountain report in the morning and tomorrow to see if Ski Patrol gives the ok to open any new terrain. Our team is eager to take advantage of these colder temperatures ahead as we push to make as much snow as possible across our eight peaks.</p><p>If you are around for the <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/mlk-weekend">weekend</a>, make sure to head to South Ridge tonight for <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/apres-and-nightlife">Live Music</a> at the Foggy Goggle, <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/mlk-fire-dancer">Fire Dancing</a>, and <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/fireworks">Fireworks</a> to end the day. <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/booklodging?Checkin=2023-1-12&amp;Checkout=&amp;Adults=2&amp;Children=0&amp;Others=0#/room" target="_blank" title="One night stays" rel="noopener">One-night stays</a> are now available for MLK Weekend at the Grand Summit and Snow Cap Inn.&nbsp; Availability is limited.
