<p><strong>March 1, 2022</strong></p><p>Take Tuesday turns on stunning stripes! Groomers pushed out all that freshly made snow on Ecstasy last night, and replaced it with beautiful corduroy for you to carve this morning. Catch 9AM first chair and enjoy more than 80 groomed trails, or ski plentiful powder stashes. Snowguns blasted all night on trails including Obsession, Tourist Trap, Cascades, and Lower Starlight for you to shred them all-natural today.
