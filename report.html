</h6><p style="color: #696969; font-weight: 900; font-size: 12px;">SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 7</p><div><p><strong>We are now 100% open!</strong> With 15&rdquo; of new snow in the last week, we were able to drop ropes on the last bit of closed terrain. Plus, it looks like we may get a couple of inches of snow later this afternoon. Get out there early to enjoy pristine corduroy on all eight peaks or hop into the glades for powder stashes. If you&rsquo;re looking to carve some cruisers, check out trails like Risky Business, Northern Lights, and Lollapalooza. To those who are just learning, head to South Ridge for access to the best beginner and learning terrain. If you&rsquo;re staying at the Grand Summit Hotel, there is also great green terrain off of Little White Cap Quad.</p><p>Lifts will start spinning at 8AM. Skip the Sunday brunch and have first tracks instead. If you need to fuel up after some fun runs, take a look at our <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/river-guide">River Guide</a> for info on all the places you can eat across the mountain.</p><p>When enjoying the snow out there, please keep in mind lift lines may appear longer than they actually are. Due to social distancing in and between lines, plus guests only riding with their traveling group, lines look longer than we're used to seeing, but move rather quickly.&nbsp;</p><p><span>Please note we are&nbsp;</span><a title="Online Store" href="https://shop.sundayriver.com/s/lift-tickets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>requiring online lift ticket purchase</strong></a><span>&nbsp;and setting </span><strong>limits on the number of tickets</strong><span>&nbsp;sold for each day. This includes full-day, half-day, beginner, Threedom additional days, and Passholder Friend tickets. We only expect these limits to affect peak dates, but encourage everyone to buy early to ensure access on the dates you want. Season passes, Ikon passes, and lift ticket packs remain direct-to-lift with no restrictions or reservations.</span></p><p><span>Fast and contactless lift ticket pickup is available at our PUBs (Pick Up Boxes) at base lodges and hotels. Just scan the barcode at the bottom of your confirmation email and your RFID cards will print with your lift tickets or ticket packs loaded. For best results turn off dark mode on your phone if you use it and avoid email apps that use dark backgrounds.</span></p><p><span>Please remember to take a self-administered </span><a title="Health Screening" href="https://www.sundayriver.com/covid">Health Screening</a><span> and visit our&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/covid">COVID Winter Guide</a><span>&nbsp;before each trip to stay up-to-date on safety protocols and state guidelines.</span></p><p>Masks up!</p><p><span>Team Snow</span></p></div><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
