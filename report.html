Morning Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: January 15, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 6:17 AM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>Good moring everyone, hope you're all able to come out and take advantage of the long weekend, because conditions are excellent. We had a brief but powerful snow squall come through yesterday evening around 4:30 that gave us a couple extra inches of light fluffy snow, and while it won't make for a powder day, you might be able to find some little pockets to play in across the resort. For the trails that receive a later groom, that new snow got processed into the cord and will be a sweet surface for you to make your first turns of the day.</p><p>Besides that, it's business as usual. The natural terrain that was open yesterday will remain open, with the chance of a few rope drops throughout the day. Everything that normally gets groomed was tackled last night, and snowmaking continues to cover the mountain in a nice white blanket. We will also have Merrill Hill today at 9AM with skiing off Double Refraction.</p><p>There will not be twilight skiing tonight. Our next evening for <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/winter-activities/night-skiing" title="Night Skiing | Sunday River, Maine">twilight skiing</a> will be next Friday, January 19.
