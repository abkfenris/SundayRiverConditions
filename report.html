Morning Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: March 11, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 7:30 AM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>The storm yesterday was a beautiful sight, as we received around 8 inches of snowfall, helping prove that winter is still in full swing!</p><p>The grooming team was out early this morning throughout the eight peaks. They put stripes on the usual terrain, and those trails should ski and ride pretty nicely out there this morning. Natural terrain will be on the firmer side today, so it's recommended to stay updated and check the report below, as some trails may be closed due to current conditions.</p><p>This morning has brought strong winds ranging from 35-45mph, leading to some lifts on wind hold. Keep an eye on the mountain report for the latest updates on lifts and trail conditions throughout the day.</p><p>Be sure to check out our <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/eddy-and-betty-dinner-mar-12" title="Eddy &amp; Betty Dinner | Sunday River, Maine">Eddy &amp; Betty Dinner</a> tomorrow evening.
