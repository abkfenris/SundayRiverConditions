<h4><strong>January 27, 2023 | 7:35</strong></h4><h4><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h4><strong style="font-size: 2em;">Morning Report</strong></h4><p>Yesterday's interesting conditions are all in the past as our grooming team worked long through the night to smooth out and break up that top layer of frozen crust. They scattered our eight peaks to get those stripes back on our trails in preparation for a great weekend ahead. Be cautious entering the woods today, as a top layer of icy crust may make it difficult to maneuver through the trees.</p><p>Snowmakers took advantage of the temperatures last night and turned on over 200 snow guns. Some of these guns will remain on today, actively making snow on trails such as Bear Paw, Wild Fire, Rocking Chair, Prism, Express Lane, and Sundance. Our team is pushing to open more trails in the upcoming days, using the snow we have received and made to fill in holes and surface our terrain. Ski Patrol will be on the slopes early to inspect closed trail conditions and evaluate their safety for the public. Hopefully, we will see a few ropes begin to drop and more terrain open as the day goes on.</p><p>The weather today will be lovely as temps will reach the mid to high-20s, and clouds will begin to disappear by mid-morning as the sun pokes through. We hope you can make it up to the heart of western Maine this weekend and get at least one day of skiing and riding in here at Sunday River.</p><p>See you at the top!<br />-Team Snow</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
