<strong>November 26, 2021</strong></p><p style="text-align: left;">Snowmaking is in our DNA. In a week, we went from opening day to top-to-bottom skiing on two lifts. With the forecast calling for picture-perfect cold into the foreseeable future, the snowmaking team will be back at it as early as tonight with terrain expansion on their minds.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: left;">For today, head to Barker and Locke for a mix of groomed and ungroomed terrain and expect soft snow. Head to Upper Sunday Punch for terrain park action and say hi to our Park Crew. Lifts open from 8AM-3:45PM today through Sunday. We are considered <strong>expert terrain only</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: left;">All lift tickets need to be <a href="https://shop.sundayriver.com/" title="online store">purchased online in advance</a>. <span style="font-weight: 400;"> Have your RFID from last year? You can head straight to the lift!</span>&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: 400;">All skier services will be based out of Barker Lodge. Season Pass Office is also open at South Ridge Lodge and we will have shuttle service between Barker, South Ridge, and the hotels while the lifts spin. We are now accepting cashless forms of payment only. Please be sure to have a gift card, resort charge, credit card, or debit card available for on-site purchases.&nbsp;</span></p><p><b>COVID-19 Protocols</b></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though we are no longer requiring guests to wear masks in general areas, we suggest masking indoors.
