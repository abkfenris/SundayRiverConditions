</p><p style="color: #696969; font-weight: 900; font-size: 12px;">SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 21</p><div><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrE6O76tiVQ">What a day!</a> It was the perfect bluebird day with endless sunshine and drool-worthy conditions. This morning the corduroy was pressed out to perfection and the afternoon is filled with soft packed powder. Hopefully, you had a chance to hit the slopes and work on your mask tans today (it's the new goggle tan) and enjoy the sunshine and fresh air. Starting tomorrow we return back to our normal mid-week schedule with <strong>lifts opening at 9AM</strong>. Tonight the snowcats will hit the slopes to lay down a beautiful corduroy carpet. Tomorrow it looks like we could get a few inches of snow from Mother Nature, which would be a nice little refresh for the already stellar conditions. It's going to be a beautiful week on the mountain, folks.&nbsp;</p><p><span>We&nbsp;</span><a title="Online Store" href="https://shop.sundayriver.com/s/lift-tickets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>require online lift ticket purchase</strong></a><span>&nbsp;and set&nbsp;</span><strong>limits on the number of tickets</strong><span>&nbsp;sold for each day. This includes full-day, beginner, Threedom additional days, and Passholder Friend tickets. We only expect these limits to affect peak dates, but encourage everyone to buy early to ensure access on the dates you want. Season passes, Ikon passes, and lift ticket packs remain direct-to-lift with no restrictions or reservations.</span></p><p><span>Fast and contactless lift ticket pickup is available at our PUBs (Pick Up Boxes) at base lodges and hotels. Just scan the barcode at the bottom of your confirmation email and your RFID cards will print with your lift tickets or ticket packs loaded. For best results turn off dark mode on your phone if you use it and avoid email apps that use dark backgrounds.</span></p><p><span>Please remember to take a self-administered </span><a title="Health Screening" href="https://www.sundayriver.com/covid">Health Screening</a><span> and visit our&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/covid">COVID Winter Guide</a><span>&nbsp;before each trip to stay up-to-date on safety protocols and state guidelines.</span></p><p><span>See you tomorrow,</span></p><p><span>Team Snow</span></p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
