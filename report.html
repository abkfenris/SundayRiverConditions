Morning Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: December 14, 2023 </strong></em><strong>| 7:37 AM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>Today, we'll be doing what we do best: snowmaking. With temperatures in the high teens and lower twenties, we have the perfect window for blowing snow. Sunny skies and over 220 acres of skiable terrain make it a great day to get out on the hill.&nbsp;</p><p>Our grooming team hit most of our terrain throughout the night, so there's fresh corduroy for all. We now have a pop-up park within the Race Arena that's open to the public. Our snowmaking team was busy throughout the night, and they will be busy throughout the day, as well. Most of our snowmaking will take place on closed terrain today, but please note that there will be active snowmaking at the top of the Chondola and by the North Peak Lodge. Please be aware that the Surface Lifts and Sundance will be closed today.&nbsp;</p><p>We're now less than two weeks away from Christmas, and today is the last day to take advantage of the <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/christmas-vacation-weeks" title="Christmas Week | Sunday River">Holiday Sale</a>. Take up to 20% off lodging and score lift tickets at discounted rates during the holiday break.
