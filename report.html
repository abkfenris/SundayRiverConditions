Afternoon Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: February 14, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 1:31 PM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>It's a chilly one, and the wind has picked up at this point. This morning brought us corduroy on most of our open terrain, and the carving opportunities were endless. Our lower mountain lifts are currently unaffected by the wind, so be sure to check out the terrain off of the South Ridge Express and the Little White Cap Quad. By tomorrow, the wind should lighten up, and we're looking at mostly sunny skies with temps in the low to mid-twenties.</p><p>Our snowmaking team will be resurfacing terrain across the resort tonight, and they'll be blasting snow on about 13 trails. Our grooming team will be out as well, and they're going to be working in some of the new man-made snow on tails like Cascades and Rogue Angel. Trails with snowmaking on them tonight will likely remain ungroomed tomorrow.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/presidents-week" title="Presidents' Week | Sunday River, Maine">Presidents' Week </a>starts in a few days, and we have events planned for the whole family.
