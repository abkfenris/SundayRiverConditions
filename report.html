<b>&nbsp;</b></p><p style="color: #696969; font-weight: 900; font-size: 12px;">TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 16</p><div><p>Even though we didn't get the powder day we hoped for, it was still an awesome day kicking up sugary snow. With 1-2" on the ground, we can't complain. Plus, we have<strong> another storm heading our way in just a couple of days</strong>. Remember, it's never too early to start snow dancing. Until then, we will enjoy the sunshine and sweet corduroy tomorrow. Tonight, the groomers will hit the slopes to press in the new snow on all eight peaks. Get here early to slash up the morning stripes or make your way through the glades. If you're just learning, we suggest parking at South Ridge for access to the best beginner terrain.&nbsp;</p><p>Lifts open at 8AM every day this week. Twilight skiing will continue tonight through Saturday for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/presidents-week">Presidents&rsquo; Week</a> with access to the Chondola and South Ridge Express until 6:30PM. As you plan your trip,&nbsp;keep in mind lift tickets are limited and days are close to selling out, so plan ahead if you want to hit the slopes this week.
