<h4><strong>January 6, 2023 | 7:25 AM</strong></h4><h2><strong>Morning Update</strong><span></span></h2><p>Thank you mother nature, for the little dusting last night, but our Mountain Ops team will take it from here. The cold temps were just what they needed to get the snowmakers out and the groomers running. Snow guns were blasting areas of Jordan and Aurora for most of the night and will remain on into the morning. Snowcats smoothed out the rest of the resort and redrew those perfect lines onto the trails. Today's conditions should be smooth and fast, staying firm as our temps remain just below freezing.</p><p>The White Heat Quad will be back today, providing access to a freshly groomed top-to-bottom run on Obsession. Heats Off, Snowbound, and Tempest were also pushed smooth and groomed clean early this morning.</p><p>Some signs of snowfall are in the forecast for parts of today, so maybe mother nature will provide the gift we have all been wishing for.
