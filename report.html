</p><p style="color: #696969; font-weight: 900; font-size: 12px;">WEDNESDAY, MARCH 17</p><div><p>What. A. Day. The slopes are perfectly sunkissed this afternoon; stop what you're doing and get out here now! Tell the boss you've got a meeting - with the mountains. They should understand. There's still a few more hours of fun to be had, with springy and fun snow all across our eight peaks. Mother Nature even gave us a break from the wind! Once you finish up on the hill, it's time to celebrate St Paddy's Day. Break out your green outfits and make a reservation at the <a href="/x5392.xml">Foggy Goggle</a> or snag a spot at&nbsp;<a href="/resort-dining/barker-bar">Barker Bar</a> to celebrate. Tonight the groomers will head out to press that corduroy and set us up for a sweet Thursday. Lifts start spinning at 9AM tomorrow, so if you can't make it out today, do your best to snag first chair then.</p><p>Due to the shift to colder temps the last few nights, some of our naturals are closed. Looking ahead we have some warmer days in the forecast, so keep an eye out for ropes dropping over the next week.</p><p>Our <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/special-deals">Spring Fling Flash Sale</a> is live!
