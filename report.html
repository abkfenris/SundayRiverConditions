LIFT TICKETS ARE SOLD OUT FOR SATURDAY, JANUARY 16 &amp; SUNDAY, JANUARY 17</h6><p style="color: #696969; font-weight: 900; font-size: 12px;">THURSDAY, JANUARY 14</p><p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="color: #333333;">Happy Thursday! The long weekend has almost arrived, but before it does hit the slopes today for some mid-week bliss. Lifts start spinning at 9AM. Snow conditions have been incredible with amazing corduroy blanketing all eight peaks. Yesterday ropes dropped on White Heat for the first time this season with fun snowmaking whales. Today, keep your eyes on Lost Princess as ropes could potentially drop there today. As we head into the weekend terrain expansion has been the name of the game. Snowmaking has continued on trails like Vortex, Wildfire, and Salvation, and it also started up on Top Gun and South Paw last night. To put the cherry on top, <strong>it looks like Mother Nature could drop 5-8" of new snow on Saturday</strong>,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>but keep your fingers crossed we avoid any mixed precipitation.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></p><p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline;"><span color="#333333" style="color: #333333;">Join us on <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/mlk-weekend">Martin Luther King Jr. Weekend</a> for twilight skiing Friday and Saturday, an Indie Demo Day on Saturday, and fireworks with a fire dancer Saturday night.</span></p><p>Lodging is still available at both of our slopeside hotels and the budget-friendly Snow Cap Inn.
