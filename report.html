</p><p style="color: #696969; font-weight: 900; font-size: 12px;">FRIDAY, MARCH 19</p><div><p>With sunshine, freshly pressed corduroy, and even <strong>overnight snowmaking</strong> added to the mix, kicking the weekend off early sounds like a fantastic idea. Conditions have been awesome all week and are only about to get better this weekend with endless blue skies in the forecast. Hop on first chair at 9AM for some fast carving and expect the snow to soften a bit throughout the day. For some turns in the fresh snowmaking this morning, head to trails like Sunday Punch and Right Stuff. For fun carving, head to American Express, Northern Lights, or Rogue Angel. Our snowmaking team plans to continue to fire up the snow guns tonight. We are&nbsp;holding onto winter but also getting ready for an awesome spring around the corner.</p><p>Please note that there is some wind forecasted today that might affect upper elevation lifts. Continue to check lift status for updates. Due to work on our newest real estate project at <a href="https://sundayriverliving.com/merrill-hill/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Merrill Hill</a>, our Ridge Run and Ski Back trails will be closed to both uphill and downhill traffic today.&nbsp;</p><p>With the weekend looking so good you won't want to leave.
