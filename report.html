<p><strong>December 10, 2022 | 6:30AM</strong></p><p>This morning, the sun makes its way over the distant mountains showing clear skies. Over 300 snow guns were hard at work throughout the resort, helping expand our terrain, while creating a deeper snowpack and softer trails. Broadway, Sundance, and Lower Mixing Bowl will have snowmaking on until lifts open and will not be groomed today. Up at Spruce Peak, American Express will have active snowmaking during the morning, but Risky Business was groomed overnight. Barker and White Cap terrain will remain the same and was given a visit from the snow cats last night also.</p><p>Temperatures will range just below freezing throughout the mountain, but with clear skies forecasted, the sun will be out there to help soften the snow and warm your face. If you're around for the weekend, don't forget to sign up for <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/santa-sunday">Santa Sunday</a> or head to South Ridge tomorrow to see over 250 Santas hit the slopes. Please be cautious while skiing new terrain, as snow conditions vary. With over 150 acres of open terrain there are enough turns out there for everyone.</p><p>&nbsp;We will see you out there!</p><p>-Team Snow</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
