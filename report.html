<h4><strong>April 3, 2023 | 7:27 AM</strong><strong></strong></h4><h4><strong style="font-size: 2em;">Morning Report</strong></h4><p>Good morning and happy Monday to all our skiers and riders! We've got a fantastic day lined up, so make sure to get up here and enjoy it. Conditions last night were much better for the grooming team, so all the regularly groomed terrain will be dressed in its finest corduroy. Conditions may start out a bit firm, but it is forecasted to be warm and sunny today, so that'll soften up and be some phenomenal spring skiing. Natural terrain will likely begin the day as closed but patrol will assess througout the day and open when it's safe to do so.</p><p>Please note that in order to access condos off of Ridge Run, you must<strong> take Dream Maker and then turn onto Ridge Run</strong>. We have operations on 3D cutting over the Ridge Run road and cannot have thru-traffic.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;We have a lot still going on here at Sunday River; as we wind down the season be sure to check out our <a href="/spring" title="Spring Operation Schedule">Spring operations schedule</a> and end-of-season<a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events"> events</a>. Next on the list, Pond-A-Palooza and the second spring concert series on Saturday and an Easter egg hunt and Passholder lunch on Sunday.&nbsp;</p><p>See you out there!<br />-Team Snow</p><h4>A Note:</h4><p>Spring brings with it some of the best conditions of the year, but also the most variable condition. Please note that trail conditions may vary and change rapidly throughout the day.</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
