Morning Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: February 27, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 7:35 AM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>We've got another incredible day coming right up. The forecast is calling for a Tuesday full of sunshine, warm temps, and soft snow. If you haven't started on your goggle tans yet, this is looking like a great day to get on it.&nbsp;</p><p>We're also excited to share exciting news from the world of lift ops. The Aurora Quad is scheduled to return to service this morning. Huge kudos go out to our lift maintenance team for working around the clock to get the lift back spinning.</p><p>Snowmaking will remain offline while the team continues to assess the forecast and find feasible windows to make more snow. Rest assured, their early season efforts have paid off, and we have tons of snow to play with on over 750 acres of open terrain. Grooming has also been busy, continuing to work their magic across all eight peaks. We recommend the groomers in the morning but keep an eye out for natural trails opening up this afternoon as the temps rise.&nbsp;</p><p>For tonight, we'll have our next <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/eddy-and-betty-dinner-feb-27">Eddy &amp; Betty Dinner at South Ridge</a>. Join your favorite yetis for an evening of fun and activities with color stations, a book reading, and a magic show.&nbsp;</p><p>Lastly, it's never a bad time to review the Skier Responsibility Code. Take a moment, refresh yourself before heading out, and please remember to go slow in the base areas.</p><p>We'll see you out there!</p><p>- Team Snow</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
