<h4><strong>March 27, 2023 | 2:33 PM</strong><strong></strong></h4><h4><strong style="font-size: 2em;">Afternoon Report</strong></h4><p>Today was a phenomenal day on the hill! Classic spring skiing with warm temps and a fierce blue sky. The weather over the next few days look to be pretty similar, so today was a preview of things to come. There may be a bit more cloud action tomorrow, but that's looking like it'll clear up later in the week. We're almost to the end of March, and the skiing is still fantastic so don't put your skis away just yet! Please also note that <strong>South Ridge quad will reopen tomorrow</strong> for the rest of the week.</p><p>But even if you have put your storage wax on for the season, we've still got plenty of activities coming up the next few weekends to keep you entertained. This weekend is <a href="/events/spring-fest-weekend" title="Spring Fest">Spring Fest</a> over at White Cap. The party starts Friday night and goes through Sunday afternoon.</p><p>It's going to be an amazing spring, so why not ski or ride <strong>for free</strong>?
