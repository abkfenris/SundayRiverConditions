Afternoon Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: January 23, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 1:34 PM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>Oh, what a day it's been. The sun has struggled to come out today, but temps remained extremely comfortable, and the snow has been soft and smooth. Plus, these clouds may bring some snow with them, so we can't complain too much. We're not bullish on totals, but 1-3" of snow could&nbsp; fall throughout the night, which could lead to a wonderful Wednesday on the slopes.</p><p>For tonight, our snowmakers are pushing hard to take advantage of the temps while they last. We are expecting to lose temps over the next night or two, but we'll be ready to pump out the snow as soon as cold temps return.</p><p>The grooming team will have another busy night, with a full slate of grooming to do, as well as several trail builds. Obsession and Lower T72 will both be getting attention, so stay tuned for opening announcements on those trails, as well as others.</p><p>Looking to step up your game and improve your skills? <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/lessons">Lessons</a> are available all week with our incredible Snowsports School instructors. White Heat will be opening up soon, so make sure you're ready.</p><p>We're officially into Senior Week, and we have a whole list of events, musical bingo, a comedy show, and karaoke.
