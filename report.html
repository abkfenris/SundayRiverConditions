Afternoon Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: January 20, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 1:41 PM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>It's cold out there, but the skiing is excellent. Groomers, natural and man-made powder stashes, and snow flurries; what more could we ask for? 716 acres of skiable terrain and 17 lifts make for a great day of skiing and riding, and there's more of that in store for tomorrow.&nbsp;</p><p>It will be a little bit warmer tomorrow, with highs in the low twenties in the base areas and low teens up top. It'll stay cold throughout the night, and our snowmakers will be finishing up on this set of trails before moving elsewhere on the mountain. Our grooming team will be laying stripes on the usual trails, as well as pushing out trails with snowmaking on it, like Jungle Road and Cascades. We're expecting corduroy on about half of our terrain tomorrow. Be sure to check back here for the most updated trail and lift info.&nbsp;</p><p>The lifts may stop, but the fun does not.
