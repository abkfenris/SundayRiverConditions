<h4><strong>February 1, 2023 | 2:25 PM</strong></h4><h4><strong style="font-size: 2em;">Afternoon Report</strong></h4><p>The colder temps have certainly settled in; however, the calm winds and bright skies created some what comfortable conditions for skiing and riding today. Trails remained smooth for the day, keeping it fast and firm. Some warm-up breaks were necessary today, keeping those toes and fingers intact for another run. As the day went on, ski patrol got onto trails to inspect the closed terrain. They dropped a few ropes and grew our trail access to over 800 acres.</p><p>Overnight Snowcats and Snowmakers will get to work grooming open terrain smooth and making snow for further expansion. They plan on grooming the usual trails for tomorrow, and the Snowmakers will put a fresh layer of snow on Spruce trails such as American Express and Risky Business.</p><p>It looks like another cold one tomorrow as temps will max out mid-day at around 25 degrees. Winds will be relatively calm, and the sun will peak through the clouds during parts of the day. If adequately dressed, it should be a fantastic day of winter riding up here at Sunday River.</p><p>Bundle up, and we will see you out there!<br />-Team Snow</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
