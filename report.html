Morning Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: November 20, 2023 </strong></em><strong>| 7:21 AM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>Happy Monday one and all! We've got a good news/less awesome news deal today. The less awesome news is Rogue will not open today. As noted in yesterday's afternoon report, the groomers got on the hill last night to push out the piles and will continue their work today. The good news is the plan is to have it back open and groomed for tomorrow. Speaking of grooming, all the other usual suspects received fresh stripes of cord. Additionally, we have <strong>moved the hike park</strong> to the bottom of Excalibur with the same 4 rail features.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Please note that Boots On and Boots Off may require walking, depending on your comfort level with navigating early season obstalces.&nbsp;</p><p>For those needing ticket assistance, a Guest Service station is located in the bottom terminal of the Jordan 8. All Ikon Pass holders who need assistance must visit the Welcome Center in the South Ridge Base Lodge. Additionally, from now until December 1, all rentals for Type 2 skiers and above, can be made, in person only, at the Sunday River Rental Shop. The equipment rental shop is located in the tunnel at the South Ridge base area.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Please note that early-season, variable terrain will be present on all trails. Lastly, don't forget to check out our <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/early-season" title="Early Season Guide | Sunday River, Maine">Early Season Guide</a>.</p><p><span>Locke Mountain will continue to serve as the resort's dedicated early-season training venue for our partners Gould Academy and Bates College, as well as for pre-booked ski teams only. All public access to snow surfaces will be through the Jordan Bowl.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Please note that as crews work to expand the resort, all uphill travel is prohibited. The current <a href="/mountain-report#uphill_status">Uphill Route Status</a> can be found at the bottom of the Mountain Report. Also, all construction areas remain off-limits. Thank you in advance for allowing our crews the space to safely expand our terrain and complete the last steps of exciting new projects.</span></p><p>As always, keep an eye here for the latest info on our lift and trail status, as well as any other operational updates.</p><p>Think cold!</p><p>- Team Snow</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
