We hope everyone has let their legs rest a bit after last weekend's spring skiing because we're gearing up for another round starting tomorrow.</p><p>The Jordan 8 will be spinning starting at 8AM and will access a variety of trails from the summit. As of this writing, we're expecting 13 trails and over 100 acres, plus a park on Lollapalooza, but Patrol will have the final details in the AM.&nbsp;</p><p>Please note that spring conditions are in full effect. There are no beginner trails currently open. Terrain conditions can and will change throughout the day, so remember to ski in control.&nbsp;</p><p>For additional information on spring operations, please visit our <a href="/spring">Spring Schedule</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>We will see you out there!</p><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">- Team Snow</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
