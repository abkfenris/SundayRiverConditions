Afternoon Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: December 27, 2023 </strong></em><strong>| 1:39 PM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>Temps in the high thirties today made for some soft snow and delightful turns. Our 166 acres of open terrain were groomed and forgiving, perfect for laying right into those edges. Ready to do it again tomorrow? We sure are.</p><p>Our grooming team will cover the same lineup of trails as last night, so we can expect the Tempest Quad, Locke Triple, Barker 6, South Ridge Express, and Sundance Surface Lifts again tomorrow. Because of the warmer temps, we&rsquo;re still on a snowmaking pause. Our next temperature window may be Friday, so think cold. As soon as temperatures allow, our snowmaking team will be firing up those guns and expanding our terrain back to Jordan.</p><p>In case you missed it, we have dinner with <span><a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/winter-activities/eddy-and-betty-the-yetis">Eddy and Betty</a> </span>tonight, complete with a magic show. We have other great events lined up throughout the week, so be sure to check out our <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/christmas-vacation-weeks" style="font-style: inherit;"><strong>events page</strong></a> for all the info. Keep an eye on the <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/river-guide">River Guide</a> for a full list of current hours. Remember to check with area restaurants and businesses for updated hours as they work to reopen following the storm.</p><p>Many, many thanks to everyone who has supported Sunday River through this recovery process. We wouldn&rsquo;t be here without everyone who helped.</p><p>We'll see you out there!</p><p>- Team Snow</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
