<h4><strong>March 16, 2023 | 7:30 AM</strong><strong></strong></h4><h4><strong style="font-size: 2em;">Morning Report</strong></h4><p>It's another crisp March morning here at South Ridge base, and we are excited about another day of excellent skiing and riding today. Last night's colder temps dried out the snow, and groomers laid down a smooth product for us this morning. Trails will start the morning firm and fast but will certainly soften as the sun begins to shine and temperatures rise to the low 40s by mid-day. Winds are forecasted for today, but we are told all is reasonably calm. As always, keep an eye on the mountain report for any lift status changes.</p><p>We are getting to the point in the season where conditions will begin to vary noticeably throughout the day. Firm and smooth in the cold mornings and soft, playful, and possibly moguled up by the late afternoon. The sun's strength will become a significant deciding factor in the trail's conditions. With more nice weather ahead and even some chances for more snow, there is a little bit of fun for everyone here in the heart of western Maine.</p><p>Looking to ski Sunday River next year?
