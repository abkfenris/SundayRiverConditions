<h4><strong>January 29, 2023 | 1:30 PM</strong></h4><h4><strong style="font-size: 2em;">Afternoon Report</strong></h4><p>The midday snow flurries are sticking around, turning our mountains into a winter wonderland. Snow should begin accumulating in the early afternoon, adding a nice little layer on top of our base by the end of the day. In the morning, all should be calm, with mild winds and cloud-filled skies. Temps will range from the mid-20s to mid-30s, creating very comfortable ski conditions for the end of January. By the last chair tomorrow, there may be another round of snow flurries going into the night.</p><p>Our Mountain Ops team is back on the clock tonight, making snow on closed terrain and sending snowcats all over our eight peaks to smooth out skied-up moguls and resurface the trails with beautiful corduroy stripes.</p><p>It's looking like another great week of skiing and riding here in western Maine as winter has arrived, bringing colder temps and the possibility of more snow later this Week.</p><p>&nbsp;See you out there!<br />-Team Snow</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
