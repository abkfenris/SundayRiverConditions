<h4><strong>April 8, 2023 |&nbsp; 6:35AM</strong><strong></strong></h4><h4><strong style="font-size: 2em;">Morning Report</strong></h4><p>Happy Saturday! If you've peeked at the forecast, you'll know we're in for a treat today. Last night and this morning stayed on the colder side, which was welcomed for our team of groomers who were able to get out earlier to give the mountain its daily refresh. They hit their usual slate of trails, with the addition of Merrill Hill, leaving perfect stripes behind. The Tempest headwall has been smoothed out this morning as well. Some of the gusty winds from yesterday are still hanging around this morning, but are expected to die down as the day goes on. Please keep an eye on the mountain report for the latest operational updates as winds may impact lifts. The snow will be firm to start the day, but with endless sun and temps hanging around the 40's, it should soften up nicely this afternoon.&nbsp;</p><p>This weekend is packed with awesome Spring events. <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/pond-a-palooza.xml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pond-a-palooza</a> starts at 11AM in South Ridge, with free registration starting at 9AM in the Welcome Center.
