<h4><strong>January 24, 2023 | 7:30 AM</strong></h4><h2><strong>Morning Report</strong><span></span></h2><p>We officially claim today as tight turn Tuesday as our woods remain open, and soft mogul fields begin to fill the sides of our advanced terrain. Some rather just point em downhill, but quick turns and playful slashes of the snow always bring a smile to our faces. Especially when there are still powder stashes to be found on our eight peaks.</p><p>Snowmakers hit the slopes last night, getting as much snow on the ground as possible. They were blasting snow out of nearly 300 snow guns onto open trails such as Express Lane, Wild Fire, South Paw, and a few other closed trails across the resort. These guns will remain on for the morning until we lose the necessary temps to create a quality snow product. Groomers hit the trails late last night and early this morning to push out skied-off areas, smooth our winding trails, and put down those beautiful Sunday River stripes for another great day of skiing and riding.</p><p>Clouds will continue to pass by all day as temps remain in the mid-20s to mid-30s. We do have some strong gusts of wind coming through this morning. These gusts should begin to fade as the day goes on, but keep an eye on the lift statuses for any wind holds we may have this morning.</p><p>&nbsp;See you on the slopes!<br />-Team Snow</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
