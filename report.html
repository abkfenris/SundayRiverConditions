<h4><strong>March 26, 2023 | 6:30 AM</strong><strong></strong></h4><h4><strong style="font-size: 2em;">Morning Report</strong></h4><p>Good morning, and happy Maine maple Sunday. Mother nature blessed us overnight with a beautiful blanket of snow. We received a little over 3" here at the base. The snow quality is relatively light and fluffy, impressive for the end of March. There could be a little more snow higher up the mountain, and we are seeing more possibly coming this morning for the first few hours.</p><p>The grooming team got onto the mountain early last night and managed to get fresh stripes on our trails before most of the snowfall. Most peaks should see fresh snow on top of smooth trails this morning waiting for first tracks. Beginner trails on South Ridge, North Peak, and White Cap are being groomed this morning and will ski excellently with the new snow mixed into the surface.</p><p>We are seeing temps ranging in the 30s on this beautiful Sunday. Mostly cloudy skies, light winds, and even some light snowfall to start the morning. Winter may be over, but mother nature doesn't want the ski season to end quite yet.</p><p>It's going to be an amazing spring, so why not ski or ride <strong>for free</strong>?
