Afternoon Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: March 4, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 1:07 PM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>Anyone else's legs burning? That was some phenomenal soft snow to slide around on. If you've got any plans to ski Top Gun, we'd recommend getting after it today, because it's skiing really well. It definitely stayed on the warmer side and allowed the natural trails to loosen up a bit. Going into tonight, temps don't look to cool down until later so that could mean a reduced grooming attack in order to preserve our snowpack. Check back in the morning for the full list of groomed terrain. Besides that, tomorrow's weather looks fairly similar, so you can use today as a gauge for how to layer.</p><p><span>As always, check out the <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events">events calendar</a> for the lineup of activities and performances throughout the rest of the month.
