Morning Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: February 14, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 7:33 AM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>It's a cold one out there today, folks, so make sure to bundle up before you head out. This cold snap is here for the foreseeable future, which means snowmaking galore. Today, we're looking at temps in the mid to high teens, mostly cloudy skies, and a bit of a breeze. Please note that higher winds may impact operations today. Check out the lift and trail status below for the most up-to-date information.&nbsp;</p><p>Our grooming team was out through the night last night, laying corduroy on our standard midweek trails. Most of our green and blue terrain was groomed, as well as some of our classic advanced cruisers. Start the day off with some relaxed turns at Little White Cap, or head over to Barker for some carving on Right Stuff. Please note that Tourist Trap, Road Runner, and the upper sections of Lazy River and Cascades will remain ungroomed with active snowmaking.&nbsp;</p><p>Looking ahead, <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/presidents-week" title="Presidents' Week | Sunday River, Maine">Presidents' Week </a>is right around the corner, and we have events planned for the whole family.
