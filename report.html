Afternoon Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: April 26, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 12:45 PM</strong></h5><p>It's always bittersweet when it comes, but it's time. Closing weekend for the 2023-24 ski season is upon us. Thanks to colder temps up high, the snowpack has made it through the week pretty well, which is going to set us up for an excellent final weekend.</p><p>The Jordan 8 will spin from 8AM-4PM on both Saturday and Sunday. For tomorrow, we're expecting to have Rogue Angel, Excalibur, Lollapalooza, Boots On, Boots Off, Grand Ave, Kansas, Lost Princess, Northern Lights, and Firestar open for skiing and riding. Temps are expected to drop overnight, so there is a chance that ungroomed terrain will start the day closed, but with temps rising quickly, they should open quickly. Final calls will be made before opening, so check here for the most up-to-date information.</p><p>As we look ahead, Sping Sale rates on <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/season-passes">2024-25&nbsp; New England Passes </a>are still available until April 30. April 30 is also the last chance to renew your pass from last year, take advantage of 0$ down, 0% financing for qualified purchasers, and secure Youth Gold passes for <strong>just $599.</strong> Winter will be back in no time, so lock in your next season for less.</p><p><span>We'll see you out there!</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">- Team Snow</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
