<h5>January 25, 2022</h5><p>Flurries are flying on nearly 700 acres of open terrain this morning! We have already accumulated 1-2&rdquo; of new snow, continuing to light snow through first chair at 9AM. Groomers put down fresh corduroy on 78 trails last night. Today we have over 100 open trails for you to choose from, and more coming as we ski through the week. Lifts are spinning until 3:45PM this afternoon so you can have a full day on the slopes. Look forward to us expanding on the most open terrain in the East, as the forecast calls for piles and piles of snow this weekend!</p><p>Please note that ski-in access to the Jordan Hotel requires the navigation of intermediate trails to reach Jordan Bowl.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Around the Resort</strong><o:p></o:p><a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/wicked-air-and-apres"></a></p><p><a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/senior-week" target="_blank" title="event details" rel="noopener">Senior Week</a> is here, from January 24 to 28!
