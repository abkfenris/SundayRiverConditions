<h4><strong>April 12, 2023 |&nbsp; 7:27 AM</strong><strong></strong></h4><h4><strong style="font-size: 2em;">Morning Report</strong></h4><h6><strong style="font-size: 2em;">8:15AM Update; The Gould Academy Surface lift will be open to the public at 9AM this morning. All other lifts remain on wind hold.&nbsp;</strong></h6><p>Good Morning! We're at the serendipitous time of year when the temps seem to rise with the sun in the morning. While the skies are mostly sunny, we are expecting high winds in our area this morning that will impact our usual lift schedule. Spruce Peak triple&nbsp; and Barker Express will start the day on a wind hold and the Jordan 8 is starting the day on a mechanical hold. Our team is working diligently to resolve the issue and hopes to spin again as soon as we are able to do so. As always, please keep an eye on the mountain report for the latest operational updates throughout the day. The Gould Academy Surface Lift will be ready to load the public at 9AM this morning with access to your choice of freshly groomed, soft and playful natural terrain, or well-manicured bumps for you to enjoy off the . Another beautiful spring day is ahead of us here in Western Maine, and we hope you're able to make it out for a couple of laps and an apres beverage on the Barker deck<span>.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Please keep in mind that<strong> there is no skiing access out of South Ridge.&nbsp;</strong>Please also note that the boundaries towards the White Cap side of the resort have changed due to the closing terrain. Ski patrol has marked closed terrain, so if you see a rope, it's there for a reason. It's also worth mentioning that Ridge Run condo owners will have to head to Barker for chair access. Finally, Roadrunner is open, but for condo owners only.&nbsp;</p><p>As we wind down for the season be sure to check out our <a href="https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fclick.e.sundayriver.com%2F%3Fqs%3D3532f2a14112686f004c4d6db9936e36ccd25ab280453910571def6e065fe5af72430f4e68e0d57a37bc27ee15491331bde1be0271549030&amp;data=05%7C01%7Ccommunications%40sundayriver.com%7C8d93f7c7dd5043d02a4d08db376097a7%7C20fea68a11ec4b24a9055061d8e916d0%7C0%7C0%7C638164660220742442%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=oHsof1omnMs54vpYabTAQJCVYEzCG4%2F6U%2BD%2BtrpaO%2FY%3D&amp;reserved=0">Spring operations schedule</a> for all of the info on what lifts are spinning and when.</p><p>-Team Snow</p><h4>Mountain Notes:</h4><p>With the terrain closures, we <strong>only have green-level skiing out of the Jordan</strong> basin.</p><p>If you're looking to get over to Jordan from Barker or Spruce, ski on over to the Spruce Peak Triple and take Sirius &gt; Aludra &gt; Cyclone &gt; State Fair.
