<h5>December 12, 2021</h5><p>Carve something new every run, we have the most open terrain in the East so you'll always have fun! It was a sunny day on the slopes, with pleasant temperatures and blue skies. This week we will be adding even more corduroy trails for your enjoyment, while snowmakers blast guns throughout the mountain. Tomorrow the new hike park on Flow State will be open to the public with several features. Barker, South Ridge, the Chondola, Spruce, and White Cap Quad are all spinning from 9AM-3:45PM tomorrow. Come enjoy over 200 acres of skiable terrain!</p><p>Please note that our only beginner terrain is available within the South Ridge Express Quad at this time. With this in mind, skiing into the Grand Summit Hotel is currently accessible via blue terrain. Although the White Cap Lodge and Grand Summit Hotel are now ski-in/out, all skier services including shopping and guest service are temporarily concentrated to Barker and South Ridge Lodges. The Welcome Center at South Ridge Lodge will be closed briefly from Sunday, December 12 at 5PM until Monday, December 13 at 8AM while new flooring is installed for your convenience. During this time, guests will not have access to in-person consultation with our Guest Service team, but may contact them via email or phone.
