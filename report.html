</p><p style="color: #696969; font-weight: 900; font-size: 12px;">SATURDAY, MARCH 6</p><div><p>Happy Saturday! The sun is shining and it's been a beautiful day out there. After a few days of hard work from our snowmakers on Barker and Spruce, they will be taking a well-deserved break. American Express was definitely the run of the day with fun turns in the fresh snowmaking. Keep it up out there and ski or ride until 6:30PM with twilight skiing and end your night on the slopes with a fireworks show at 7PM.&nbsp; Come back tomorrow for more sunshine and hop on first chair at 8AM to start working your way across the peaks.&nbsp;</p><p>Please note that the Chondola cabins have been taken off to increase the likelihood of the lift spinning.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>If you are looking for a last-minute getaway we are now offering one-night stays for tonight at the Snow Cap Inn and Jordan Hotel</strong>. Availability is limited so please call <strong>800.543.2754</strong> to book. Remember, when you book lodging with us you are guaranteed a lift ticket even when we are sold out like we are for today.&nbsp;</p><p><span>The <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/season-passes" title="Season Passes">2021-22 New England Pass is back on sale</a>, granting access to Sunday River, Loon &amp; Sugarloaf all next year.
