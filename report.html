<h4><strong>February 28, 2023 | 7:32 AM</strong></h4><h4><strong style="font-size: 2em;">Morning Report</strong></h4><p>February is heading out after today, but not without leaving us with some nice powdery presents first. Today's snow has moved in earlier, and heavier, than expected, with 2" already fallen at the higher peaks. Snow is expected to continue the entire day, so free refills will definitely be on tap.</p><p>The grooming team had an excellent run last night, taking the fresh snow we received Sunday and re-working it into the surface. Their work was quickly covered, but rest assured, there is an excellent, carvable base below this fresh snow.&nbsp;</p><p>We're currently 100% open, with 884 acres across 8 peaks for you to explore.&nbsp;</p><p>Keep the snow dances going, we're just getting started.<br />-Team Snow</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
