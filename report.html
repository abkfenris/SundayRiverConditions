<h5>December 9, 2021</h5><p>Soft snow and plenty of sunshine made for a fun day on the slopes, and we're ready to do it all again tomorrow. The grooming team will be putting fresh stripes on all of our open terrain for the morning, when lifts open at 9AM on Locke, Barker, Spruce, and South Ridge. We have new terrain coming on Saturday with the White Cap Quad opening for ski-in/ski-out access for the Grand Summit Hotel, and new trails like Jibe, Lower Starlight, Road Runner, Snowbound adding to the trail count, along with Sirius, Aludra, and Lights Out making their season debut.&nbsp;</p><p>Snowmaking tonight is continuing to push even more skiable terrain in the coming weeks. The snowguns will be blasting on Lollapalooza, Cyclone, State Fair, Rogue Angel, Dream Maker, Snowbound, Obsession, Starlight, Road Runner, Lights Out, Rocking Chair, Double Dipper, and Sundance. Say that 10 times fast. We'll see you for first chair.</p><p><strong>Around the Resort</strong></p><p>Join us this weekend at the <a href="/events/feztival-of-trees" title="Feztival of Trees">Feztival of Trees</a> for some holiday cheer!
