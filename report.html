<h4><strong>February 15, 2023 | 2:00 PM</strong></h4><h4><strong style="font-size: 2em;">Afternoon Report</strong></h4><p>Trail conditions today kept their shape and quality as the day went on. Partial cloud coverage kept the sun from softening the snow too fast, and the fresh groomers remained firm and fast for most of the day. Some areas where snowmaking was active overnight were soft, fun, and playful, while at the base, the made snow did seem to feel a little slow in some spots due to today's warmer temps.</p><p>Looking at tomorrow, our team will spread out over the resort after the last chair today to regroom our surface and lay down fresh stripes onto our open terrain. Snowmaking will remain off tonight as temperatures will stay relatively warm and mild. By the first runs tomorrow, we will already see temperatures reaching close to the 40s and rising throughout the day. Sun should be able to poke through partial clouds making tomorrow another spring-like day in the middle of February. The snow surface will undoubtedly soften up but mid-day creating playful skiing conditions in some comfortable, warm temps.</p><p>There may be no need to pack the extra layers tomorrow, just more water for yourself after a long day of incredible skiing here in Western Maine.<span data-preserver-spaces="true"></span></p><p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span data-preserver-spaces="true"><a href="https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sundayriver.com%2Fbooklodging&amp;data=05%7C01%7Cmatthew.falconer%40sundayriver.com%7C9cd67ba4dfe24aceae8808db0f50cc2d%7C20fea68a11ec4b24a9055061d8e916d0%7C0%7C0%7C638120611930009704%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=SbnCdb3CVqZ%2FXqgSzIAJtkif%2BUWrgYVtqh214UkmSlg%3D&amp;reserved=0">One-night stays</a> are now available for Presidents' Week.
