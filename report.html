</p><p style="color: #696969; font-weight: 900; font-size: 12px;">TUESDAY, MARCH 16</p><div><p>It's been a beautiful day with sunshine and fun carving. We even found some stashes of snow on the side of Rogue Angel from Sunday's unexpected snowfall. After a solid few days of snowmaking, the snow guns have been shut off on Right Stuff, Sunday Punch, and Ecstasy, and our snowmaking team is taking a well deserved break. Groomers will hit the slopes tonight to roll out a fresh carpet of corduroy on over 80 trails. Get here for first chair tomorrow at 9AM and enjoy some midweek bliss with crisp corduroy and sunshine.</p><p>Please note that the Chondola cabins will remain off today, but will be put back on and ready for tomorrow's turns. Due to the shift to colder temps most of our naturals will be closed, but looking ahead we have some warmer days in the forecast, so keep an eye out for ropes dropping over the next week.</p><p>Our <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/special-deals">Spring Fling Flash Sale</a> is live!
