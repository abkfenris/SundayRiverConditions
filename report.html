Winds may temporarily impact lifts this morning, so please check the lift and trail status as we keep you updated. Last night groomers put down corduroy across the mountain to carve at first chair. With the most available terrain in the East, we are starting today with 110 trails after adding 7 to our growing list yesterday. Check out recently opened Shock Wave, Hard Ball, Gnarnia, and Blind Ambition. All scheduled lifts are spinning from 9:00AM-3:45PM for a full day of skiing.
