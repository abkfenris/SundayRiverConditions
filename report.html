<h4><strong>January 17, 2023 | 7:32 AM</strong></h4><h2><strong>Morning Report</strong><span></span></h2><p>Good morning Sunday River! After an unsettled day yesterday, it's shaping up to be a lovely Tuesday here in Western Maine. Partly cloudy skies during the morning are expected to give way to sunshine throughout the day, with temps expected to be above freezing for much of the day. The grooming team was busy last night, tackling 62 trails and working in yesterday's mixed precipitation. Thanks to their efforts, and the warm temps throughout the day, expect tons of fun, edgeable snow for your delight.&nbsp;</p><p>Looking ahead, the storm system appears to be picking up steam. The cycle we're in has to give way at some point, doesn't it? Until then, our snowmakers will keep their foot on the gas, and make winter happen regardless of what Mother Nature thinks.</p><p>&nbsp;See you up there!<br />-Team Snow</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
