<p><strong>November 28, 2022 | 7:19 AM</strong></p><p>Well, they say a day on the hill is better than a day in the office. Last night wasn't the weather we dream of, but we're happy to report that we have not lost any terrain. Risky Business and Right Stuff did not receive a groom last night, but all the other usual suspects are primed and ready to go. Barker will not spin today, but all the terrain off of it is still open. Temps look reasonably warm which will give you some nice snow to play on and the sun may try to peek out in the afternoon.</p><p>As always, variable conditions exist and there is <strong>no beginner terrain</strong> available at this time.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;- Team Snow</p><p></p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
