Afternoon Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: January 8, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 1:25 PM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>Today was good. Really good. The groomers did an amazing job churning in that fluffy snow from yesterday and made a buttery smooth surface for today. Fortunately the wind quieted down enough to let Aurora spin, but at this time, we do still have the Chondola on hold.</p><p>Tempest didn't open up today, but there is still talk of it being opened tomorrow. That will be a decision for ski patrol in the morning. But as a reminder, it is currently closed with snowmaking equipment on the trails, so please utilize Road Runner if you're looking for condo access.&nbsp;</p><p>Now you've all probably been keeping a keen eye on the weather, and believe us, we have too. Tomorrow evening looks to be the start of what could be a pretty significant storm. Some models have us recieving up to 1.5 feet of snow, with the storm potentially ending on the warmer side...as in above 32 degrees...you can probably read between the lines there. Fortunately, as the storm has developed, the prediction for amount of unfrozen precip has consistently decreased, so we've got our fingers, toes, and eyes crossed that trend continues.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/special-deals/dash-deals-sale" title="Dash Deals | Sunday River, Maine">Dash Deals</a> will be online for only a few more days.
