Are you going to answer?&nbsp;Well we think you should, and tell your boss it&rsquo;s an important business call. It&rsquo;s never a bad idea to extend your weekend an extra day, especially when Monday looks this good. Last night the groomers worked their way from peak to peak pressing out perfect stripes for fast turns today. Over the weekend snowmakers resurfaced trails like American Express, Risky Business, Ecstasy, Right Stuff, and Sunday Punch, so you won&rsquo;t want to miss those. Today is a great day to work on the latest fashion trend, the mask tan, believe us when we say it&rsquo;s the way cooler version of the goggle tan.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;Hop on first chair at 9AM.</span></span></p><p><span>The <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/season-passes" title="Season Passes">2021-22 New England Pass is back on sale</a>, granting access to Sunday River, Loon &amp; Sugarloaf all next year.
