SOLD OUT OF TICKETS FOR TODAY, JANUARY 30</h6><p style="color: #696969; font-weight: 900; font-size: 12px;">SATURDAY, JANUARY 30</p><p><strong>7:30AM update: the Little White Cap Quad will have a delayed opening this morning due to a mechanical issue.&nbsp;</strong></p><div><p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline;"><span color="#333333" style="color: #333333;">Happy Saturday! We're kicking off the weekend with 120 trails and over 700 acres to ski and ride on. Ropes have been dropping left and right over the past week on trails like Blind Ambition, Celestial, Flow State, and Tightwire. Yesterday our snowmakers finished up their work on Risky Business and Lower Broadway and will be taking a well-deserved break. Groomers hit the slopes overnight to press stripes on their normal routes, adding in Risky Business, South Paw, and Three Mile Trail. Bundle up and hop on first chair this morning at 8AM to carve it up, try out the newly opened terrain, and make your way across all eight peaks. Keep it up all the way to 6:30PM with twilight skiing out of South Ridge and then end your night on the slopes with a fireworks show at 7PM.&nbsp;</span></p><p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline;"><span color="#333333" style="color: #333333;"><span style="color: #333333;">Please note that we are expecting some wind today at higher elevations that might affect lifts. Our team has taken the Chondola cabins off for the weekend for a better chance of avoiding a wind hold.
