Afternoon Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: March 18, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 1:16 PM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>It's been another magnificent Monday out on the mountain. Don't be fooled, there's still a ton of great skiing left to be had this season.&nbsp;</p><p>The grooming team will be taking to the hill tonight and will continue to work their magic across all 8 peaks. Please note, Lazy River below Three Mile will be closed tomorrow for an on-hill project. Access to Spruce from the top of the Barker 6 will be via Three Mile.</p><p>Snowmaking will be off tonight as the temps aren't going to get quite cold enough but are planning to be out tomorrow night firing up the guns to continue resurfacing key trails. We're also following a few more snowmaking windows later this week and into next. The team is planning on taking advantage of every chance they get, so be sure to thank a snowmaker the next time you see them on the hill.</p><p>Later this month, come check out events like <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/bust-n-burn" title="Bust 'N' Burn | Sunday River, Maine">Bust 'N' Burn</a> and <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/spring-fest-weekend" title="Sping Fest Weekend | Sunday River, Maine">Spring Fest Weekend</a> with activities for everyone in the family.
