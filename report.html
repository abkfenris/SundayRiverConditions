At this point we do not have a confirmation on timing to restore power, so please check here tomorrow morning prior to visiting the resort. Assuming power is restored tonight, we plan to open at 9AM but may have delayed openings on select lifts</em><strong>.</strong></p><p><span>Looking ahead, we're expecting sunshine on the slopes later in the week and into the weekend, and our grooming team will be out nightly across the mountain . March always brings us the best sunshine and some snowy surprises. It&rsquo;s never too early to start planning your next <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/resort-lodging">weekend getaway</a>.</span></p><p><span>If you get hungry while on the slopes we have multiple indoor and outdoor&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/river-guide" style="font-size: 9pt; text-decoration-line: underline; color: #9685ba;">dining options</a><span style="font-size: 9pt;">&nbsp;available this winter, including the ability to order online for select venues</span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">.</span><span class="Apple-converted-space" style="font-size: 9pt;">&nbsp;</span></p><p>We note that we&nbsp;<a title="Online Store" href="https://shop.sundayriver.com/s/lift-tickets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">require online purchase of lift tickets</a>&nbsp;and limit&nbsp;the number of tickets<span>&nbsp;sold for each day. This includes full-day, beginner, Threedom additional days, and Passholder Friend tickets. We only expect these limits to affect peak dates, but encourage everyone to buy early to ensure access on the dates you want. Season passes, Ikon passes, and lift ticket packs remain direct-to-lift with no restrictions or reservations.</span></p><p><span>Fast and contactless lift ticket pickup is available at our PUBs (Pick Up Boxes) at base lodges and hotels. Just scan the barcode at the bottom of your confirmation email and your RFID cards will print with your lift tickets or ticket packs loaded. For best results turn off dark mode on your phone if you use it and avoid email apps that use dark backgrounds.</span></p><p><span>Please remember to take a self-administered </span><a title="Health Screening" href="https://www.sundayriver.com/covid">Health Screening</a><span> and visit our&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/covid">COVID Winter Guide</a><span>&nbsp;before each trip to stay up-to-date on safety protocols and state guidelines.</span></p><p><span>Masks up!</span></p><p><span>Team Snow</span></p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
