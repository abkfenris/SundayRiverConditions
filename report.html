<h6>December 4, 2021</h6><p>Three words: major. terrain. expansion! Today, we opened American Express off of the Spruce Peak Triple, and fired up the Chondola for the first day of the season, opening Escapade, Grand Rapids, and Lower Downdraft along with it. We're heading into Sunday Funday with <strong>the most open terrain in the East,&nbsp;</strong>and we're not stopping there. The snowmakers will continue their wintry efforts on American Express, Sirius, Aludra, Lights Out, Lower Downdraft, Grand Rapids, and Escapade tonight, while the snowcats will be doing their nightly rounds of corduroy. Plus, don't miss the new park features in Wonderland, as well as the terrain park on Upper Sunday Punch if you're feeling sendy.&nbsp;</p><p>Tomorrow, we'll be spinning five lifts from Locke to South Ridge from 8AM-3:45PM, and it's going to feel very jolly on the slopes with the <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/santa-sunday" target="_blank" title="event" rel="noopener">21st Annual Santa Sunday</a> event. Registration is open online to be one of 250+ Saint Nicks skiing down the Broadway trail around 11AM tomorrow, all for a great cause.&nbsp;</p><p>All lift tickets need to be <a href="https://shop.sundayriver.com/" strong="" title="online store">purchased online in advance</a>. Have your RFID from last year? You can head straight to the lift! Skier services are available in both the Barker and South Ridge Lodges, as well as shuttle service between these lodges and the hotels while the lifts spin. We are now accepting cashless forms of payment only.
