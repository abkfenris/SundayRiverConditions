<h5>January 31, 2022</h5><p>The only blues we are feeling this Monday, is a classic bluebird! We have nearly 800 acres of open terrain for you to enjoy this afternoon. Expansion comes with powder days, and we have gained almost 100 acres since first chair. Ropes have dropped on trails including Black Hole, Super Nova, Celestial, Chutzpah, Shock Wave, and more. Lifts are spinning until 3:45PM for you to carve the day away on 80 groomed trails, or enjoy the 12-14" of new snow stashes across all 8 peaks!</p><p>Please note that ski-in access to the Jordan Hotel requires the navigation of intermediate trails to reach Jordan Bowl.</p><p><strong>Around the Resort</strong><o:p></o:p><a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/wicked-air-and-apres"></a></p><p>For the latest updates on available shopping, dining, and activities whenever you visit us, head to the <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/river-guide" target="_blank" title="river guide" rel="noopener">River Guide</a>.<o:p></o:p></p><p>-Team Snow</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
