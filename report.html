<b>&nbsp;</b></p><p style="color: #696969; font-weight: 900; font-size: 12px;">MONDAY, FEBRUARY 15</p><div><p>We need your help. The first of two storms rolls in this evening and forecasts are calling for<strong> 5-9" of new snow</strong> before the storm heads out tomorrow afternoon. Then we're looking at beautiful sunshine for stash hunting midweek, followed by <strong>another storm Thursday night</strong> into Friday. So here is where you come in: whether it's wearing your pajamas inside out, snowdancing your buns off, or praying to Ullr, we need you to act on your superstition of choice. This week has the potential for up to 2 feet of snow before the weekend, so let's get those PJ's flipped, dance moves busted, and snow gods smiling.&nbsp;</p><p>Lifts open at 8AM every day this week. Tonight the groomers will get out there before the snow finishes and plan on taking another lap around South Ridge and North Peak. With new snow falling during the day, beginner terrain may appear ungroomed as the snow accumulates over time. Twilight skiing continues through Saturday for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/presidents-week">Presidents&rsquo; Week</a> with access to the Chondola and South Ridge Express until 6:30PM. As you plan your trip,&nbsp;keep in mind lift tickets are limited and days are close to selling out, so plan ahead if you want to hit the slopes this week.
