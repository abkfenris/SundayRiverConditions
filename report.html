<p><strong>February 5, 2022</strong></p><p>Your happy place awaits today. We are 100% open, thanks to yesterday's 18" of fresh snow, bringing our total for the last week to nearly 3 feet. The stashes are endless in the trees, thanks to our <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/boundary-to-boundary" title="Boundary to Boundary">boundary-to-boundary skiing</a>. Groomers put stripes on more than 80 trails for you to carve into beautiful corduroy for first chair at 8AM.
