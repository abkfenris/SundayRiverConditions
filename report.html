<p><strong>February 26, 2022</strong></p><p>Sunshine lights up miles of powder piles this morning!&nbsp; Not a cloud is in sight, after 8" of new snow shines across 8 peaks, paired with snowmaking. Snowguns blasted all night on Right Stuff, Risky Business, and Lower Sunday Punch for you to enjoy all-natural today. Catch 8AM first chair and carve new stripes on more than 80 trails. Groomers pushed out large snowy moguls on Dream Maker last night, and made beautiful corduroy for you to enjoy this morning. Take tree skiing turns on powdery glades, including Last Tango, Wizard's Gulch, Tightwire, Yetiville, Gnarnia, and more. We are starting with 105 glades and trails for you to shred, spanning nearly 700 stunning acres. Ski away your Saturday under the sun with day lifts spinning until 4PM, then head <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/winter-activities/night-skiing.xml" title="Twilight Skiing">Twilight Skiing</a> under the stars until 6:30PM.
