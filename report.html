<h4><strong>April 13, 2023 |&nbsp; 7:25 AM</strong><strong></strong></h4><h4><strong style="font-size: 2em;">Morning Report</strong></h4><p>It's going to be a gorgeous day in Western Maine with sunny skies and warm temperatures reaching the mid-70s in the afternoon. Today is a great day to remember to pack sunscreen!&nbsp;</p><p>To start the morning, Spruce Peak and Barker Express will be spinning with the Jordan 8 on mechanical hold. Our Mountain Team is working diligently to get it back online. As always, keep an eye on the Mountain Report for the latest operational updates throughout the day.</p><p>Please keep in mind that<strong> there is no skiing access out of South Ridge.&nbsp;</strong>Please also note that the boundaries towards the White Cap side of the resort have changed due to the closing terrain. Ski patrol has marked closed terrain, so if you see a rope, it's there for a reason. It's also worth mentioning that Ridge Run condo owners will have to head to Barker for chair access. Finally, Roadrunner is open, but for condo owners only.&nbsp;</p><p>As we wind down for the season be sure to check out our <a href="https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fclick.e.sundayriver.com%2F%3Fqs%3D3532f2a14112686f004c4d6db9936e36ccd25ab280453910571def6e065fe5af72430f4e68e0d57a37bc27ee15491331bde1be0271549030&amp;data=05%7C01%7Ccommunications%40sundayriver.com%7C8d93f7c7dd5043d02a4d08db376097a7%7C20fea68a11ec4b24a9055061d8e916d0%7C0%7C0%7C638164660220742442%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=oHsof1omnMs54vpYabTAQJCVYEzCG4%2F6U%2BD%2BtrpaO%2FY%3D&amp;reserved=0">Spring operations schedule</a> for all of the info on what lifts are spinning and when.&nbsp;</p><p>Have fun and ski safe!&nbsp;</p><p>-Team Snow</p><h4>Mountain Notes:</h4><p>With the terrain closures, we <strong>only have green-level skiing out of the Jordan</strong> basin.</p><p>If you're looking to get over to Jordan from Barker or Spruce, ski on over to the Spruce Peak Triple and take Sirius &gt; Aludra &gt; Cyclone &gt; State Fair.
