Mother Nature even joined in on the fun and sent huge flakes our way giving us 1-4" of new snow. Last night snowmakers took on White Heat and tonight they are going to shift gears over to Risky Business and keep the guns going on Right Stuff. Tomorrow, hop on first chair at 9AM for fast groomers and soft snowmaking. Snowcats will head out once the sun goes down to press in the new snow, plus the flakes are still falling, so keep dancing! Please note that due to the gusty winds lingering until tomorrow, the Chondola cabins will remain off.&nbsp;</p><p><span>The <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/season-passes" title="Season Passes">2021-22 New England Pass is back on sale</a>, granting access to Sunday River, Loon &amp; Sugarloaf all next year.
