</h6><p style="color: #696969; font-weight: 900; font-size: 12px;">MONDAY, JANUARY 11</p><p>Today is going to be a gorgeous Monday on the mountain with mild temps, blue sky, sunshine, and stripes across all eight peaks. Plus, with the sun shining all day you can even work on your mask tan (it&rsquo;s the new goggle tan). Last night groomers and snowmakers took over the slopes to work their magic. Snowmaking continued on trails like White Heat, 3D, Cowardly Lion, Lost Princess, and Downdraft plus started up on trails like Wildfire, Mixing Bowl, and Grand Rapids. Groomers made their normal rounds and also added stripes on Airglow. Extend your weekend or head into work late today and hop on first chair at 9AM. &nbsp;</p><p>Looking ahead, we're pushing to add even more terrain for the three-day Martin Luther King Jr. weekend and offering <a href="/special-deals/mlk-lodging" title="MLK lodging sale">20% off resort lodging</a>. Both of our slopeside hotels are ski-in/ski-out and have access to green terrain.&nbsp;</p><p>All three base areas lodges are open with full services at South Ridge including season pass pickup, shopping, and rentals. There are several additional&nbsp;<a style="font-style: inherit;" href="https://www.sundayriver.com/resort-dining"><strong>dining options</strong></a>&nbsp;around the resort, but please keep in mind that capacity is limited.</p><p><strong>Lift ticket pick up</strong>: Fast and contactless ticket pickup is available at our PUBs (Pick Up Boxes) throughout the resort. Just scan the barcode at the bottom of your confirmation email and your RFID cards will print with your lift tickets or ticket packs loaded. Don't forget to turn off dark mode on your phone if you use it.&nbsp;</p><p>As we continue to adjust resort operations to prioritize the safety of our guests, we are now&nbsp;<a title="Online Store" href="https://shop.sundayriver.com/s/lift-tickets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>requiring online lift ticket purchase</strong></a> or reloading and setting <strong>limits on the number of tickets sold</strong> for each day. This includes day, half-day, beginner, Threedom additional days, and Passholder Friend tickets. We only expect these limits to come into play on peak dates, but encourage everyone to buy early to ensure access on the dates you want. Season passes, Ikon passes, and lift ticket packs remain direct-to-lift with no restrictions or reservations.</p><p>Lastly, please remember to check our <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/covid">COVID Winter Guide</a> before each visit to make a plan for your day and stay on top of any potential changes. We&rsquo;re in this together and need your help.</p><p>Tips up!</p><p>- Team Snow</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
