Opening Day Announcement</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: November 13, 2023&nbsp;</strong></em><strong>|&nbsp;<em>2:30PM</em></strong></h5><p>Come tomorrow, we'll be sliding on snow. In case you haven't yet heard, the 2023-24 ski season will officially begin this Tuesday at 9AM for New England Pass, Ikon Pass, and Ticket Pack holders, with daily operations beginning immediately. Daily lift tickets will be accepted beginning Wednesday. <strong>Please note, that there will be no beginner terrain available</strong> at the start of the season, and early-season, variable terrain will be present on all trails.&nbsp;</p><p>This year, we're heading west and will <a href="/early-season" title="Early Season Guide | Sunday River">be opening in the Jordan Bowl</a>. Top-to-bottom skiing and riding will be serviced by the Jordan 8, featuring ride times under 5 minutes. The plan is to have Lollapalooza as a top-to-bottom run, with Boots On &amp; Boots Off providing ski-in, and ski-out access to the Jordan Day parking lot. Rumor on the hill is Rogue Angel may even make an appearance if these cold temps persist and let our snowmakers continue to work their magic. A hike-park is planned in the Jordan Basin for those looking to work on their lip on blind 2's.</p><p>The Jordan opening is a huge shift that we couldn't be more excited about, and will make for an unprecedented early-season experience. For all of the details, and a list of FAQs, check out our <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/early-season" title="Early Season Guide | Sunday River, Maine">Early Season Guide</a>.</p><p><span>In another new addition for this season, Locke Mountain will serve as the resort's dedicated early-season training venue for our partners Gould Academy and Bates College, as well as pre-booked ski teams only. All public access to snow surfaces will be through the Jordan Bowl.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Please note that as crews work to open the resort, all uphill travel is prohibited. The current <a href="/mountain-report#uphill_status">Uphill Route Status</a> can be found at the bottom of the Mountain Report. Also, all construction areas remain off-limits. Thank you in advance for allowing our crews the space to safely open the mountain.</span></p><p>Be sure to keep your eyes here for any and all updates as opening day approaches!</p><p>Think cold!</p><p>- Team Snow</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
