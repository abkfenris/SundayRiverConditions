Morning Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: February 11, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 6:35 AM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>This Sunday will bring us temperatures in the mid to high thirties, variable winds, and a hint of sunshine. As temperatures dropped overnight, terrain firmed up, putting an end to the softer turns of yesterday. Today, we have 19 lifts scheduled for 872 acres of open terrain. Check out our lift and terrain status below for the most up-to-date information throughout the day.&nbsp;</p><p>Our grooming team had a later start last night to give the temps some time to cool down. We're looking at 80 groomed trails today, which is over half of our open terrain. Most of our green and blue terrain was groomed, although Three Mile Trail, Polaris, and Backside remain ungroomed. Cruise down Green Cheese or Moonstruck, get first tracks on Northern Lights, or check out Right Stuff for some morning corduroy. Our snowmaking team will be back in action tomorrow morning as temperatures allow, and they'll continue their efforts to resurface terrain across the mountain.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/presidents-week" title="Presidents' Week | Sunday River, Maine">Presidents' Week</a> is a week away, and we have events planned for the whole family.
