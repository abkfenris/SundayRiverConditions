</h6><p style="color: #696969; font-weight: 900; font-size: 12px;">SUNDAY, JANUARY 24</p><div><p>Unfortunately, the Sunday scaries were very real today. Mother Nature is feeling feisty giving us high wind and blustery temps on the mountain. All of our higher elevation lifts are on hold but will continue to be monitored until the end of the day.&nbsp;With lifts on hold, you can take advantage of the free shuttles that run across the resort from lodges to our resort hotels. This schedule can be found in the<a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/river-guide"> River Guide</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>As we look ahead, there are milder temps and sunny days on tap this week. The snow has been skiing fantastic and the snowmakers still have the flakes flying. Tonight snowmaking will continue on Quantum Leap and Mixing Bowl. The groomers will also make their way across all eight peaks to press out perfect corduroy for tomorrow. The snow is dry, squeaky, and carves like a dream so don't miss out on some mid-week runs.&nbsp;</p></div><div>This winter, your car is your base lodge. We're here to help you make the most of it by<a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/gear-up-giveaway"> giving away over $1,000 in gear from YETI </a>to help you boot up in the morning, grab a quick lunch between laps, and kick back for apr&egrave;s.</div><div></div><p><strong>Please note The Mountain Room will be closed today.</strong> There are plenty of food options around the resort for spreading out, but please remember that capacity is limited. Take a look at the <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/river-guide">River Guide</a> to discover locations, hours, online ordering, and how to make a reservation. For any needs such as season pass pickup, shopping, tuning, rentals, and SnowSports School, head to South Ridge Lodge.</p><p>We are&nbsp;<a title="Online Store" href="https://shop.sundayriver.com/s/lift-tickets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>requiring online lift ticket purchase</strong></a>&nbsp;and setting <strong>limits on the number of tickets</strong>&nbsp;sold for each day. This includes full-day, half-day, beginner, Threedom additional days, and Passholder Friend tickets. We only expect these limits to affect peak dates, but encourage everyone to buy early to ensure access on the dates you want. Season passes, Ikon passes, and lift ticket packs remain direct-to-lift with no restrictions or reservations.</p><p>Fast and contactless lift ticket pickup is available at our PUBs (Pick Up Boxes) at base lodges and hotels. Just scan the barcode at the bottom of your confirmation email and your RFID cards will print with your lift tickets or ticket packs loaded. For best results turn off dark mode on your phone if you use it and avoid email apps that use dark backgrounds.</p><p>Please remember to take a self-administered <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/covid" title="Health Screening">Health Screening</a> and visit our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/covid">COVID Winter Guide</a>&nbsp;before each trip to stay up-to-date on safety protocols and state guidelines.&nbsp;</p><p>See you tomorrow,</p><p>Team Snow</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
