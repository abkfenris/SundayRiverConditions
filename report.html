<h4><strong>February 23, 2023 | 1:15 PM</strong></h4><h4><strong style="font-size: 2em;">Afternoon Report</strong></h4><p>The fresh snow cleaned up the mountain overnight and made it feel like winter again. Although the snowfall was pretty calm during the day, it is forecasted to pick up again tonight for more fresh turns tomorrow. Our snow guns will remain off tonight, and the grooming team will hit the slopes to smooth out any formed moguls and skied-off areas.</p><p>It's looking like another cloudy day tomorrow with winter temps sticking around below 20 degrees for most of the day. Winds are forecasted to be pretty high in the middle of the day tomorrow, so keep an eye on the mountain report for any lift holds due to weather.</p><p><a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/presidents-week">Presidents' week</a> has only begun, and we still have a weekend of events and activities lined up for you.
