<h4><strong>January 31, 2023 | 3:55 PM</strong></h4><h4><strong style="font-size: 2em;">Afternoon Report</strong></h4><p>One more report and that will do it for January! It's hard to believe that we've already flown through the first month of the year, but 3 feet of snow will do that to you. We're heading into February with nearly 800 acres of skiing and riding across all 8 peaks. It's certainly a great time to be here in Western Maine.</p><p>Looking ahead, we're settling into quite a blustery cold stretch of weather. We're Mainers, we don't mind some cold, but be sure to take all the necessary precautions when on the hill.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;See you out there!<br />-Team Snow</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
