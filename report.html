<h4><strong>March 20, 2023 |7:20 AM</strong><strong></strong></h4><h4><strong style="font-size: 2em;">Morning Report</strong></h4><p>Good morning to all our Sunday River skiers and riders! We've got a phenomenal day ahead. Yesterday's "better than expected" conditions and weather will play in our favor today. Since yesterday didn't get above 32 degrees, it means the snow didn't go through that thaw-freeze cycle and should ski very well. Still a bit on the firmer side in the morning, but we're expecting temps to hit the mid to high 30s today with plenty of sun, so it's going to soften up and be a fantastic day to play. There is potential for a bit of wind, but as of now we're expecting normal operations. We'll update the Mountain Report as needed to reflect any operational changes.</p><p>And although it's only Monday, it's not too early to plan your weekend. This Friday and Saturday marks the final weekend of <a href="/winter-activities/night-skiing" title="Twilight Skiing">Twilight Skiing</a>, so if you want some after-hours turns, this is your last chance. We've also got the first of our <a href="/river-guide" title="Spring Concert Series">spring concert series</a> kicking off this Saturday, March 25.&nbsp;</p><p>We hope you can get yourself and a few buddies up to the mountains soon to enjoy great skiing, and plenty of open terrain.
