Afternoon Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: January 24, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 1:18 PM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>We had snow flurries off and on throughout the day today, resulting in up to 1" of snow accumulation. With comfortable temps and low winds, today was a great day to get in some midweek turns.&nbsp;</p><p>Our snowmaking team has been working throughout the day, and they'll continue blowing snow into this evening. The snow guns will shut off early tonight with the rising temperatures, and they'll stay off for a couple of days until the warm snap ends. Our grooming team will clean up a similar lineup of trails as last night, with the exception of some advanced terrain such as Airglow, Tempest, Right Stuff, and Rogue Angel.&nbsp;</p><p>We're officially midway into Senior Week, and we have a whole list of events for you to enjoy, including a comedy show, live music, and karaoke.
