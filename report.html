Morning Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: March 17, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 6:35 AM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>Temperatures are sitting in the low to mid-thirties across the mountain this morning, rising to the mid-thirties and low forties by this afternoon. We're looking at moderate winds today, with intermittent mixed precipitation. Accumulation will be light, with a chance of flurries this morning before things warm up this afternoon. Turns will be soft, temps will be warm, and today should be an excellent way to close out the weekend.&nbsp;</p><p>We have 765 acres of open terrain today, with 18 scheduled lifts. The Locke Triple will remain on mechanical hold. Today is also the last day of the season for the Oz Quad, the Quantum Leap Triple, and the Jordan Mountain Double, so if you want one more ride, today's the day. We have 113 open trails today, of which 73 are groomed by our grooming team. With groomed trails like American Express, Cascades, Lollapalooza, and T2, and natural terrain like Yetiville and Blind Ambition, there's something for everyone in the family. Make sure to keep an eye on the lift and terrain status below for the most up-to-date information.&nbsp;</p><p>Looking at season passes for next season? Buy your pass now, and ski this weekend.
