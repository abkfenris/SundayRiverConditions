The trails softened as the day went on, and clouds stayed around most of the day. Snow groomers will take us to the slopes tonight to clean up the trails for another day ahead. <br />Looking into the forecast, we see some warm temps, cloudy skies, and a chance for some not-so-nice weather as tomorrow continues.</p><p>Looking ahead, we've got a weekend full of <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events" title="Events | Sunday River">classic Spring events</a>. Pond-a-palooza will be taking place on Saturday, with the Great Tailgate and Passholder Appreciation lunch on Sunday!&nbsp;</p><p>Please be cautious while skiing into the South Ridge basin.
