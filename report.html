Cold temps moved in swiftly last night, allowing our snowmakers to fire up nearly 300 snowguns across the mountain. We're expecting to be able to make snow until Friday, which means new terrain by the weekend.&nbsp;</p><p>For today, expect fresh corduroy on all open terrain, courtesy of our grooming team. Pro tip from our Patrollers - Barker terrain has been skiing really well this morning and is their pick of the day. Please note, winds may impact lift operations throughout the morning.</p><p>Looking ahead, we're officially less than two weeks away from Christmas. Can you believe that?
