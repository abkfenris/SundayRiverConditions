Afternoon Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: January 9, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 2:25 PM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>Today has been another incredible day on the slopes. Thanks to the dedicated work of our Mountain Ops team, plus Sunday's snow, we're officially skiing and riding on over 300 acres of terrain from Jordan to White Cap. Our snowmakers and Mother Nature sure do make a good team.</p><p>For tonight, we have an incredibly dynamic system moving in. This storm is sort of a good news, bad news situation, so let's dig into it.</p><p>The bad news is that we are expecting a warm-up on the tail end of this storm. Forecasts for Western Maine have been shifting in our favor though, and we are not expecting significant impacts from anything non-frozen. In addition, high winds are forecasted to impact all of New England tomorrow, which may lead to lift impacts. We'll know more of how that is all shaking out in the morning.</p><p>The good (or great) news is that we are in a band of snow that may drop as much as 20" across the region. We're really lucking out with a favorable track, which means that any impacts on the back end will be minimal.&nbsp;This won't be the perfect storm, but it is exactly what we need to build a solid base for the rest of the year, and set us up for an epic weekend with more snow in the forecast for Friday.</p><p>While winter is just getting started, <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/special-deals/dash-deals-sale" title="Dash Deals | Sunday River, Maine">Dash Deals</a> are already winding down.
