</h6><p style="color: #696969; font-weight: 900; font-size: 12px;">SUNDAY, JANUARY 31</p><div><p>Sunday funday has arrived and with it we have sunshine, eight open peaks, and endless stripes. Ropes have been dropping left and right so you can take your pick from perfect stripes to hidden pow stashes in the glades such as Poppy Fields, Blind Ambition, and Celestial. The snowcats spent the night prowling the slopes for pristine corduroy from White Cap to Jordan Bowl. The snow is pure hero snow out there, dry, squeaky, and carves like a dream. If you are new to skiing and riding, head to South Ridge for the best learning terrain. Plus, there is also great green terrain out of the Grand Summit Hotel for beginners. Lifts will start spinning at 8AM today.&nbsp;</p><p>Looking ahead, it is time to start dancing as we keep our eyes on a<strong> mid-week storm heading our way that could potentially drop a foot or more of snow.</strong></p><p><span>This winter, your car is your base lodge.
