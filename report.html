</h6><p style="color: #696969; font-weight: 900; font-size: 12px;">MONDAY, JANUARY 25</p><div><p>It was a beautiful Monday on the mountain today with sunshine, stripes, and fantastic conditions across all eight peaks. This is the kind of snow that squeaks under your boots and carves like a dream. The best part? We get to enjoy it all over again tomorrow. With over 100 open trails there is a lot to explore out there. Treat yourself to first chair tomorrow at 9AM to carve across the carpet of corduroy.&nbsp;</p></div><div>This winter, your car is your base lodge. We're here to help you make the most of it by<a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/gear-up-giveaway"> giving away over $1,000 in gear from YETI </a>to help you boot up in the morning, grab a quick lunch between laps, and kick back for apr&egrave;s.</div><div></div><div>There are plenty of food options around the resort for spreading out, but please remember that capacity is limited. Take a look at the <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/river-guide">River Guide</a> to discover locations, hours, online ordering, and how to make a reservation.&nbsp;</div><div></div><p>We are&nbsp;<a title="Online Store" href="https://shop.sundayriver.com/s/lift-tickets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>requiring online lift ticket purchase</strong></a>&nbsp;and setting <strong>limits on the number of tickets</strong>&nbsp;sold for each day. This includes full-day, half-day, beginner, Threedom additional days, and Passholder Friend tickets. We only expect these limits to affect peak dates, but encourage everyone to buy early to ensure access on the dates you want. Season passes, Ikon passes, and lift ticket packs remain direct-to-lift with no restrictions or reservations.</p><p>Fast and contactless lift ticket pickup is available at our PUBs (Pick Up Boxes) at base lodges and hotels. Just scan the barcode at the bottom of your confirmation email and your RFID cards will print with your lift tickets or ticket packs loaded. For best results turn off dark mode on your phone if you use it and avoid email apps that use dark backgrounds.</p><p>Please remember to take a self-administered <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/covid" title="Health Screening">Health Screening</a> and visit our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/covid">COVID Winter Guide</a>&nbsp;before each trip to stay up-to-date on safety protocols and state guidelines.&nbsp;</p><p>See you tomorrow!</p><p>Team Snow</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
