Enjoy carving up the groomers this morning, then slash up soft snow once the sun warms things up. After snowmaking on Right Stuff and Lower Sunday Punch, groomers have pushed out the new snow and added stripes for some fun turns today. Quickly find your Easter basket this morning then head to the mountain to soak up this sunny Sunday.</p><p>Lifts will start spinning at 8AM. We have limited skier services at the White Cap base lodge, so head to South Ridge or Barker to start your day. Please note that Roadrunner will be closed today except for condo access.</p><p style="font-style: inherit;">With operations open daily through April 24, there is plenty of ski season ahead.
