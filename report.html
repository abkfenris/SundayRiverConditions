<p><strong>November 14, 2022 | 7:45AM</strong></p><p>It's. On. Last night, snowmaking operations began for the 2022-23 season, with over 200 guns firing across Locke and Barker. Cold temps are expected to persist throughout the week, allowing our amazing snowmakers to do what they do best, make winter happen. Ski season is knocking on the door, and we could not be more excited.</p><p>If you haven't dug your gear out from the basement, or you're still wondering where your goggles are, it's time to get serious. Speaking of being unprepared, <a href="/season-passes" title="Season Passes | Sunday River">season passes</a> and <a href="/ticket-packs" title="Ticket Packs | Sunday River">Maine 4-Day Ticket Packs</a> are still available. For those looking for less commitment, <a href="/lift-tickets" title="Lift Tickets | Sunday River">Lift Tickets</a> and lodging at all three of our <a href="/resort-lodging" title="Resort Lodging | Sunday River">resort properties </a>is still available for the holidays, so hurry up and book the vacation of a lifetime.
