<p><strong>December 9, 2022 | 1:40 PM</strong></p><p>As Friday begins to wrap up, snow fans continue to blow a fresh layer throughout Spruce Peak and parts of South Ridge, creating excellent conditions for any skiers or riders who were able to make it out this afternoon.</p><p>The mountain ops team will continue to create snow overnight and send their snowcats to trails without active snowmaking, smoothing out, and grooming for the days ahead.&nbsp;</p><p>This weekend's forecast looks mostly sunny, with temperatures just below freezing throughout the day. These temps will allow us to keep creating new snow where necessary and, continue our trail expansion. Even with the most open terrain in the east, nothing is stopping us from blowing more snow and opening more trails for you to explore.</p><p>Please be cautious when entering new runs, as varying snow conditions are present. Don't forget to register and make it out for <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/santa-sunday">Santa Sunday</a>, to kick off the holiday season.&nbsp;</p><p>Don't stop that snow dance!</p><p>-Team Snow</p><p>&nbsp;</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
