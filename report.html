<h4><strong>March 4, 2023 | 12:50 PM</strong><strong></strong></h4><h4><strong style="font-size: 2em;">Afternoon Report</strong></h4><p>What a day it was here in the heart of western Maine. We loaded the first chair with 8" of fresh powder under our feet, and it just kept coming down. By mid-day, close to 12" had landed, and it's not even over yet. Our lifts had some hiccups to start, but we got them running, and all of our trails were accessible and torn apart by all the powder hounds. Luckily the snow is coming down fast at up to 2" per hour, keeping the terrain smooth and soft, making today one for the books.</p><p>An epic powder day is always followed by a beautiful day of perfectly groomed trails and runs through the woods in search of fresh snow. Our mountain ops team will take to all eight peaks tonight to groom and pack down all the skied-off trails. We are seeing partly cloudy skies in the forecast tomorrow, with temps ranging from the 20s-30s. Another comfortable winter March day, perfect for exploring all the terrain Sunday River has to offer.</p><p>See you up there!<br />-Team Snow</p><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Want to enjoy the snow we have been getting recently?
