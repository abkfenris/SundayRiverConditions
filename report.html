In addition to a dusting of new snow with flakes still falling, we also experienced some icing overnight, followed by strong winds. As a result, we'll start the day with the Locke Mountain Triple, with skiing on T2 and Sunday Punch. If we're able to get the Barker Mountain Express spinning later today, we'll also have Lazy River, Tourist Trap, Right Stuff, and Ecstasy.
