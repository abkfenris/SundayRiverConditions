Afternoon Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: December 26, 2023 </strong></em><strong>| 1:49 PM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>Today we had mostly sunny skies, comfortable temps, and over 160 acres of open terrain. We appreciate everyone&rsquo;s patience with our detours around active construction as we work to repair our Mountain.</p><p>We&rsquo;re looking at the same lineup of trails for tomorrow morning, with all groomed terrain. Due to warmer temperatures, there will not be any snowmaking tonight. Once temperatures cool down, our snowmaking team will be firing up the guns and working on expanding our terrain over to Jordan, so think cold.</p><p>South Ridge reopened today, and along with it, our beginner terrain and the SnowSports School. We have lessons for everyone, whether you're putting on skis for the first time or you've been snowboarding for years.
