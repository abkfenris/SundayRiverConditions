Morning Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: April 4, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 7:40 AM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>Good morning everyone! We've got a lot to go over today, so let's jump right in. First order of business: we got snow. Currently seeing about 6" at the base with lots still coming down. That's presented its own set of problems. In case you haven't been outside, there are several hazards blocking off roads and limiting travel. Not only is this a safety hazard, but it's preventing team members from getting to the resort. With that said, we are currently planning to open South Ridge quad and Spruce. As more staff arrive, we'll be able to open more lifts (weather permitting), but that's what we're able to supply at this time.&nbsp;</p><p>The Mountain Report will be the best place to get updated information, so keep your eyes here as you're able.&nbsp;</p><p>This storm is going to create some great conditions this weekend, which is perfect timing to book a spring<a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/lessons/private-lessons" title="Private Ski and Snowboard Lessons"> ski or snowboard lesson</a>.
