<h4><strong>January 13, 2023 | 2:00 PM</strong></h4><h2><strong>Afternoon Update</strong><span></span></h2><p>As the day went on, the weather continued to change on us. We saw it all today, from light rain to thick fog and varying temperatures. Our groomers got to work early last night, allowing a fresh layer of snow to cover the trails. This new snow on top became heavier than mashed potatoes with the extra cream cheese mixed in, making conditions challenging in some spots but smooth and playful in others. It was a day of exploration to find the good stuff, enjoy it, and then learn how to maneuver in these unusual snow conditions.</p><p>The weather has calmed as the day continues, and we are looking at gray skies and mild temperatures throughout the night. Our Snowmaking team and groomers will get back to work once temps drop back down. To prepare for terrain expansion, the team will make snow and groom trails on White Cap, Oz, and Aurora. They will also tackle the rest of the open terrain and groom those perfect Sunday River stripes back into the ground.</p><p>Tomorrow's weather looks like everything is back to normal, with temperatures around freezing and clouds moving in and out of the area throughout the day. <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/booklodging?Checkin=2023-1-12&amp;Checkout=&amp;Adults=2&amp;Children=0&amp;Others=0#/room" target="_blank" title="One night stays" rel="noopener">One-night stays</a> are now available for MLK Weekend at the Grand Summit and Snow Cap Inn.&nbsp; Availability is limited.&nbsp;If you're staying around for the week with your little rippers make sure to head to <strong><a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/things-to-do/events/events/black-diamond/laser-tag">Laser Tag</a></strong> at the Ballroom at Grand Summit Hotel tonight from&nbsp; 5-7 PM!</p><p><strong>Please note:</strong> There is currently no beginner terrain into and out of the Grand Summit Hotel.</p><p>Happy Friday!<br />-Team Snow</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
