<p><strong>December 8, 2022 | 7:45 AM</strong></p><p>Good morning skiers and riders. Happy Thursday, the sun is making its way out, and the low clouds have finally lifted. It's turning into a lovely morning here on the hill with temps around 35-40 degrees all day. The mountain ops team was able to get out on the hill overnight and groom all open terrain except Monday Mourning. Last night's temps did not freeze our trails; however, please be cautious of varying snow conditions because of the recent weather we received.</p><p>Our mountain ops team will continue to work, creating more snow to expand our skiable terrain and maintain the most open acres on the east coast. Let's hope temperatures start to drop and the snow starts to fall soon, but when we fight mother nature, sometimes we have to take what we can get and enjoy it!&nbsp;</p><p>If you plan on coming up this weekend make sure to register for our <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/santa-sunday">Santa Sunday</a> event. All money raised benfits the <a href="https://www.riverfundmaine.org/.xml">River Fund</a> and its sure to be a heck of a time.&nbsp;</p><p>See you out there</p><p>-Team Snow</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
