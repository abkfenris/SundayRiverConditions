<p><strong>December 12, 2022 | 1:35 PM&nbsp;</strong></p><p>There wasn't much more you could ask for on a day like this. Conditions and weather were exactly what you want to see, so huge shout out to our Mountain Ops team and Mother Nature for making today such a great one. As we look ahead, we've got another awesome looking day tomorrow. Expect a similar setup with grooming on a majority of the open terrain and some active snowmaking throughout the day while we have a good weather window.&nbsp;</p><p>We've also got some events coming down the pipeline this weekend with <a href="/fireworks" title="Torchlight">Torchlight</a> and Fireworks on Saturday December 17. All in all, this week is shaping up to be a darn good one. We'll see you out there!</p><p>-Team Snow</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
