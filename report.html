Beat the heat and head up to the top of one of Sunday River&rsquo;s peaks for a cool breeze and stunning views of Western Maine and the White Mountains.<strong> Don&rsquo;t forget to bring plenty of water,</strong> sunscreen and a hat, and some salty snacks to keep you hydrated and cool. Many of our trails involve sections on sunny work roads, so be prepared for full-on summer conditions. Water bottle filling stations are located in South Ridge Lodge.</p><p>Lowbush blueberries have come into season! Please be respectful of other visitors to the mountain and our wildlife if you choose to pick berries. A good harvesting practice is taking less than 1/10<sup>th</sup> of what is growing in a particular spot. Plentiful berries also mean that bear activity has increased on the hill. Keep your eye out for our black bear families, and please keep your distance. A good rule of thumb for wildlife encounters is truly a rule of thumb! With your arm outstretched, an animal should appear no bigger than the nail on your thumb, if it looks any larger you are too close!</p><p>As we gear up for <strong>Tough Mountain Challenge,</strong> you may notice some obstacles beginning to take shape around the mountain. Please refrain from testing them out. Obstacles are still incomplete and may not be safe or secured.</p><p>Construction is booming up at North Peak! <strong>Some trails and the Chondola may be closed for 30-45 minute periods on Thursday (7/14) and Friday (7/15)</strong> to allow for safe blasting activities. <strong>Please be patient and adhere to all posted signs and warnings. </strong>Hiking is allowed only on designated trails. Closed means closed for your own safety.</p><p>If you are injured or need assistance at any point, don&rsquo;t hesitate to contact <strong>Patrol at (207)-824-5350</strong> or by visiting our First Aid Clinic in the bottom of South Ridge Lodge next to Betty&rsquo;s Treats and Treasures.</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
