<h5>January 18, 2022</h5><p>This afternoon we have over 100 trails for you to choose from, spanning across 585 acres! Please keep an eye on the lift and trail status as the wind calms throughout the day. Sunshine and blue skies highlight the 11" of recent snowfall, and with it comes newly opened terrain including Last Tango, Wizard&rsquo;s Gulch, Caramba, Enchanted Forest, Agony, Lock Line, Sluice, Three Mile, Starburst, and North Woods. Lifts are spinning until 3:45PM today, and open at 9:00AM for first chair.
