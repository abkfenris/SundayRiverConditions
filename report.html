<h5>December 23, 2021</h5><p>Happy Thursday, folks! Mother Nature gave us an early Christmas present with 3 inches of fresh snow yesterday! Our snowmakers also went to work last night, in order to bring you the best conditions possible. Groomers hit trails all across the mountain, including Right Stuff, American Express, Rogue Angel, and more. Today is a chilly one, so bundle up - two layers of long johns, perhaps? Once you're properly kitted out, grab a hot coffee from <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/resort-dining/coffee-hound" target="_blank" title="Coffee Hound" rel="noopener">Coffee Hound</a> at South Ridge, and meet us for first chair.&nbsp;</p><ul></ul><p>Since Jordan Bowl is open, both hotels are now ski-in/ski-out access for your convenience. Skiing into the Grand Summit Hotel is currently only accessible via blue terrain. Please note our only beginner terrain is available within the South Ridge Express Quad at this time. Additionally, <strong>there is currently active snowmaking on Lower Sundance</strong>, so it is not groomed - please bear that in mind.&nbsp; Rental snowboards are now back in stock. Come enjoy all the festivities slopeside!</p><ul></ul><p><strong>Around the Resort</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/resort-shopping/bettys-treats-and-treasures.xml" title="Betty's Treats and Treasures">Betty's Treats and Treasures</a> is now open!
