<h4><strong>March 15, 2023 | 7:30 AM</strong><strong></strong></h4><h4><strong style="font-size: 2em;">Morning Report</strong></h4><p>Good morning and welcome to your midweek mountain update. Over the last 24 hours, we have been dealing with quite the weather. Sparatic snowfall and gusty winds have left us with an excellent layer of fresh snow all over the mountain. Snow is still coming down this morning, but all should begin to calm as the temps rise. Ski patrol has warned us of some gusty winds up top. Keep an eye on the mountain report for any lift status updates as we get our lifts turning this morning.</p><p>Snow groomers got onto the hill last night to smooth out all the freshly fallen and skied-off snow. Depending on when the snowcats got onto the trail, conditions may be beautiful fresh corduroy or have a new blanket of snow on top, making things a little more playful. Temps will stick around the mid-30s today, and partly cloudy skies are in the forecast for most of the day. March does not want winter to end and keeps providing us with the product we need to keep the season going.&nbsp;</p><p>See you out there!</p><p>-Team Snow</p><h4></h4></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
