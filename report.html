LIFT TICKETS ARE SOLD OUT FOR TODAY, JANUARY 23.</h6><p style="color: #696969; font-weight: 900; font-size: 12px;">SATURDAY, JANUARY 23</p><p>Thanks to all the hard work from our snowmakers, groomers, and some help from Mother Nature, conditions have been fantastic. Yesterday ropes dropped on Shockwave, North Woods, and Absolutely for the first time this season, bringing our trail count to over 100. Our snowmakers have kept up the momentum and fired up the snow guns on Quantum Leap and our groomers hit the slopes overnight on their normal routes to press stripes. Head to trails like Right Stuff, American Express, and Escapade for some fun carving. For a challenge, head to the whalebacks on Shockwave or the steeps of White Heat. If you're just beginning, stick to the slopes of South Ridge and Little White Cap. It's going to be a chilly one, so bundle up and enjoy a Saturday on the slopes, starting at first chair at 8AM and ending at 6:30PM tonight with twilight skiing. A fireworks show is planned for tonight at South Ridge at 7PM.</p><p>Lifts will start spinning at 8AM this weekend. Please note that we are anticipating some wind for this afternoon and into tomorrow. Our team is taking off the Chondola cabins for a better chance of avoiding a wind hold. Continue to check lift status throughout the weekend for updates.&nbsp;</p><div>This winter, your car is your base lodge.
