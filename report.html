<p><strong>March 10, 2022</strong></p><p>Welcome to Thursday on the mountain. It's shaping up to be an absolutely beautiful day, with sunshine dominating the sky and soft turns under your feet. We're proud to have the best grooming team in the east, and they've surpassed even their own lofty standards. The corduroy is plentiful today and we couldn't be more excited to get our edges into it. Snowmaking on Lazy River and Lower Starlight is wrapping up as temps rise. Lazy River will remain ungroomed for the day, so head there for some fun man-made pow.
