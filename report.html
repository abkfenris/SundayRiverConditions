Morning Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: March 14, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 7:32 AM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>This morning will start off a little overcast, with temps in the low to mid-thirties. By this afternoon, the fog will have burned off, and temps will be in the mid-forties to low fifties. We're anticipating some softer turns across 709 acres of open terrain today, so throw on some extra wax before you head to the mountain.&nbsp;</p><p>Our grooming team took care of 72 trails last night, laying corduroy on over half of our open terrain. Check out some groomed green trails like Dream Maker and Lollapalooza, some blue cruisers like Rogue Angel and American Express, or try your hand at some advanced corduroy like Right Stuff and Obsession. Please note that our groomed terrain will start the morning off a little firm due to some precipitation and dropping temps last night. As soon as the temps warm up, everything will soften up. Want to venture off the beaten path? Explore some naturals like Blind Ambition, Poppy Fields, and Last Tango. As always, we have something for everyone.&nbsp;</p><p>Check out our <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events" title="Events | Sunday River, Maine">events calendar</a> for a full list of events across the mountain.
