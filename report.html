Afternoon Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: January 15, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 1:41 PM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>Another beautiful day on the hill. The snow was definitely on the fast side, but the bright blue sky and patrol adding a few more trails throughout the day certainly helped. As a friendly reminder, we return to our normal midweek schedule tomorrow with <strong>lifts starting to load at 9AM.</strong></p><p>We've got ourselves a bit of a cold snap coming up, and you better believe our snowmakers will be out taking full advantage of that. We've also got our eyes on some snow falling throughout the day tomorrow, which we'll happily accept with open arms. All in all, things are lining up really nicely.</p><p>There will not be twilight skiing tonight. Our next evening for <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/winter-activities/night-skiing" title="Night Skiing | Sunday River, Maine">twilight skiing</a> will be next Friday, January 19.
