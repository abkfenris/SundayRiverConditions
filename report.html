Add in a holiday and an incoming snowstorm, which could drop <strong>up to 9" of snow </strong>tonight and into tomorrow, and you can just start calling us Monday River.</p><p>Lifts open at 8AM every day this week. Get here early for morning corduroy on over 80 trails or hop into the woods over on Jordan Bowl to search for secret stashes. If you&rsquo;re just learning, start the day at South Ridge for the best beginner terrain. If you&rsquo;re staying at the Grand Summit, there are also great green trails off of Little White Cap Quad for some mellow turns.&nbsp;Twilight skiing continues through Saturday for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/presidents-week">Presidents&rsquo; Week</a> with access to the Chondola and South Ridge Express until 6:30PM. As you plan your trip,&nbsp;keep in mind lift tickets are limited and days are close to selling out, so plan ahead if you want to hit the slopes this week.
