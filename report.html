<h5>December 11, 2021</h5><p>Today our fantastic team grabbed their Gore-Tex and opened even more terrain for you to enjoy this season. Look forward to stripes on Jibe, Heat&rsquo;s On, Starlight, and Road Runner tomorrow. Dream Maker, Snowbound, and Obsession are open for the season as well. A new hike park is now available at the basin of Barker on Flow State! See this park in action tomorrow for the USASA Rail Jam, shred it yourself this afternoon, or starting back up Monday for public use. Barker, South Ridge, Locke, the Chondola, Spruce, and White Cap Quad lifts are all spinning tomorrow from 8AM-3:45PM. At your convenience, please keep an eye on the lift and trial status for updates when considering this weekend's mixed weather.&nbsp;</p><p>Please note that our only beginner terrain is available within the South Ridge Express Quad at this time. With this in mind, skiing into the Grand Summit Hotel is currently accessible via blue terrain. Although the White Cap Lodge and Grand Summit Hotel are now ski-in/out, all skier services including shopping and guest service are temporarily concentrated to Barker and South Ridge Lodges. We have over 230 skiable acres waiting for you to carve!</p><p><strong>Around the Resort</strong></p><p>Join us this weekend at the <a href="/events/feztival-of-trees" title="Feztival of Trees">Feztival of Trees</a> for some holiday cheer!
