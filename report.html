<h4><strong>April 1, 2023 | 6:30 AM</strong><strong></strong></h4><h4><strong style="font-size: 2em;">Morning Report</strong></h4><p>Good morning Sunday River riders, and happy April. Last night brought a fresh layer of snow for the grooming team to mix into our snowpack and freshen up our trails. Our grooming team finished up smoothing out the mountain late into the middle of the night, so things have had time to firm up and set overnight. Ski trail conditions will be firm and smooth for the morning.</p><p>If you are prepared for the forecasted weather, the skiing and riding conditions should be good for the morning. However, as the day goes on, we see some unwanted precipitation during some warmer parts of the day. Hard telling what will fall from the sky, but it will most likely be relatively wet and unpleasant. All should pass by in the early afternoon, so laps after lunch should be better as the skies clear up and the sun begins to come out.</p><p><a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/spring-fest-weekend.xml">Spring Fest Weekend</a> as finally arrived! We've got quite the line-up coming to you for a full weekend of fun. Due to the weather, we'll be moving the party upstairs in White Cap lodge.&nbsp;</p><p>It should be a great weekend of fun, skiing, and parties!</p><p>See you out there!<br />-Team Snow</p><h4>A Note:</h4><p>Spring brings with it some of the best conditions of the year, but also the most variable condition. Please note that trail conditions may vary and change rapidly throughout the day.</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
