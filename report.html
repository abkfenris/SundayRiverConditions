</h6><p style="color: #696969; font-weight: 900; font-size: 12px;">WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 3</p><div><p>Mother Nature delivered yesterday, dropping 14" of fresh snow. You know what that means? Terrain expansion and plenty of powder stashes to seek out today! This morning, we'll open with nearly 100 percent of our terrain available, including notable naturals like Last Tango, Hollywood, Emerald City, and Eureka. But if groomed terrain is more your speed, the snowcats churned that fresh snow into gorgeous corduroy on 72 trails. Please note that the Little White Cap Quad will have delayed opening while our lift maintenance team gives it a tune up.&nbsp;</p><p>This is a prime opportunity to take advantage of our<a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/booklodging?Checkin=2021-2-1&amp;Checkout=&amp;Adults=2&amp;Children=0&amp;Others=0#/room.xml">&nbsp;20% off midweek lodging sale</a>&nbsp;to stay slopeside and hop on first chair and enjoy shredding all day, or to plan ahead and lock in a room with our <a title="presidents' week sale" href="/special-deals/presidents-week">Presidents' Weekend &amp; Week Sale</a> ending this Friday.</p><p><span>Please note we are&nbsp;</span><a title="Online Store" href="https://shop.sundayriver.com/s/lift-tickets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>requiring online lift ticket purchase</strong></a><span>&nbsp;and setting </span><strong>limits on the number of tickets</strong><span>&nbsp;sold for each day. This includes full-day, half-day, beginner, Threedom additional days, and Passholder Friend tickets. We only expect these limits to affect peak dates, but encourage everyone to buy early to ensure access on the dates you want. Season passes, Ikon passes, and lift ticket packs remain direct-to-lift with no restrictions or reservations.</span></p><p><span>Fast and contactless lift ticket pickup is available at our PUBs (Pick Up Boxes) at base lodges and hotels. Just scan the barcode at the bottom of your confirmation email and your RFID cards will print with your lift tickets or ticket packs loaded. For best results turn off dark mode on your phone if you use it and avoid email apps that use dark backgrounds.</span></p><p><span>Please remember to take a self-administered </span><a title="Health Screening" href="https://www.sundayriver.com/covid">Health Screening</a><span> and visit our&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/covid">COVID Winter Guide</a><span>&nbsp;before each trip to stay up-to-date on safety protocols and state guidelines.</span></p><p>Mask up for leftovers!</p><p><span>Team Snow</span></p></div><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
