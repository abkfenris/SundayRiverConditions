<h4><strong>February 17, 2023 | 2:35 PM</strong></h4><h4><strong style="font-size: 2em;">Afternoon Report</strong></h4><p>As a Friday of skiing and riding comes to an end, our work has only just begun to prepare the resort for a busy Presidents' week ahead. The weather was not in our favor today as lightning stopped our lifts shortly in the morning, and a few hours of light precipitation did not help us much either.</p><p>Snowmakers and groomers will get onto the mountain as soon as temps allow. They will make snow in desired areas and groom as much of the hill as they can. With rising temperatures over the last couple of days and colder temperatures on their way, firm conditions will undoubtedly be present by morning. It will warm up slightly by mid-day, and the sun should come out, allowing trail conditions to become softer as the day continues.</p><p>As we kick off Presidents' week, check out everything we have going on throughout our resort. From Twilight Skiing all week long to Live bands and entertainment, there is always something going on during the holidays here at Sunday River. We are seeing some good signs of snowfall at some point later next week, which is a great reason to take advantage of our<a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/resort-lodging"> one-night stays</a> now available for Presidents' Week. All properties, all week, grab yours before they're gone!&nbsp;</p><p><span style="color: #0e101a;">We'll see you out there!</span><o:p></o:p></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true"><span style="color: #0e101a;">-Team Snow</span><o:p></o:p></span></p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
