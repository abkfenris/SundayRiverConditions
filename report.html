With temps rising throughout the morning, expect the snow to soften up and hit that fun sweet spot a bit later on. Groomers were out all night pressing fresh stripes on all your favorite trails, including Risky Business, American Express, White Heat, and more. Check out the full list below for all the details. Many of our naturals will start the day closed, but expect to see them open as soon as possible as the sun heats up the snow. Right Stuff, Sunday Punch, and Lazy River are in great shape from our snowmakers' hard work last week. It's a great day to grab a breakfast burrito from South Ridge and hop on first chair! Lifts open at 8AM.</p><p>With operations open daily through April 24, there is plenty of ski season ahead.
