Morning Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: December 11, 2023 </strong></em><strong>| 7:45 AM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>Happy Monday! We're heading straight into another incredible week of action here in Western Maine. We have a bit of a good news, bad news, situation playing out this morning. The bad news is that last night's weather was in fact of the non-frozen variety. The good news is that initial forecasts were slightly overstated, and impacts on the mountain have been minimal. Let's get into it.</p><p>The grooming team spent some time addressing key areas last night, but largely left terrain ungroomed. This allows the snowpack to drain efficiently, setting us up for an excellent night of grooming tonight. Expect soft, ungroomed terrain across the mountain today.</p><p>At this time, we do expect to lose some of our natural terrain. Patrol will be out this morning assessing conditions, with more updates to come. Please also note that wind may impact lift operations throughout the day. Be sure to follow along with the Mountain Report for the most up-to-date info.</p><p>Looking ahead, we do have a silver lining to discuss, which is the forecasted cold moving into the area this evening. Our snowmakers will have a great stretch of prolonged snowmaking temps and are planning to take advantage of every second they can. All eyes are set on expansion, and adding new terrain, and ski-out hotel access for the Grand Summit, by this weekend. If you see them on the hill, be sure to give them a huge thank you.</p><p>Think cold!</p><p>- Team Snow</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
