Morning Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: November 23, 2023 </strong></em><strong>| 6:44 AM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>Welcome to the Thanksgiving Thursday edition of the Mountain Report, and happy turkey day from us here at the River. It's shaping up to be a wonderful day out on the slopes, and we hope you join us. Don't forget to leave the cooking to us and visit Camp for <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/thanksgiving-dinner">Thanksgiving Dinner</a> this evening.</p><p>On the hill, the grooming team worked their magic, taking yesterday's snow and pressing it into perfect corduroy across Lollapalooza and Rogue Angel. Boots On and Boots Off also received a fresh groom. Excalibur is scheduled pending a final trail check from patrol and is expected to open as ungroomed, natural terrain for experts only.</p><p>Our excellent snowmakers took a well-deserved night off yesterday with temps climbing above freezing, but are slated to be back in force this evening as cold temps return to the mountain. They've been working their butts off to make winter happen, so be sure to stop and thank them whenever you get the chance.</p><p>Lastly, we've officially kicked off our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/cyber-sale" title="Cyber Sale | Sunday River, Maine">Cyber Sale,</a> with deep discounts on lodging, lift tickets, ticket packs, and other deals.
