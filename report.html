<h4><strong>March 2, 2023 | 2:30 PM</strong><strong></strong></h4><h4><strong style="font-size: 2em;">Afternoon Report</strong></h4><p>This morning's weather brought heavy snowfall with more than 3 inches of fresh snow all over the resort. As temps began to rise, the storm calmed and created a winter wonderland of a day. Snow conditions at the base started to get a little heavy as the day went on, but up top and in the woods, the snow was light and fluffy once again.</p><p>Snowcats will hit the slopes once again tonight, waiting for the perfect temps to smooth out the skied-off trails. Tomorrow's forecast is starting the morning with bright clear skies and temps in the mid-20s. By mid-day and into the afternoon, temps will rise to the high 30s, winds will remain calm, and the sun will continue to shine bright.</p><p>As the warm sun hits our trails and temps rise, conditions will most likely soften up in the afternoon, creating a creamy surface after a great morning of firmer corduroy. It looks like another chance for a lot of snow late tomorrow night and into the weekend, shaping up to be an incredible few more days of skiing and riding. If your itching for some great turns then take advantage of the weekend ahead and make your way to Western Maine for some smooth turns and beautiful mountain views here at Sunday River.&nbsp;</p><p>Winter isn't over yet!<br />-Team Snow</p><h3>A Note:</h3><p><span>Out of respect for private property, resort homes and condominium owners, we ask that guests keep their beloved pets on their leash throughout the resort.
