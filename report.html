<h4><strong>February 22, 2023 | 1:35 PM</strong></h4><h4><strong style="font-size: 2em;">Afternoon Report</strong></h4><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Today's conditions were fast, firm, and a little chalky. Grooming has created somewhat dusty conditions without significant fresh snowfall in the last weeks. The more we groom over the same snow, the finer the product becomes. This will create a playful yet firm and challenging snowpack.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Luckily Mother nature will be hanging out with old man winter tonight, making snow for us to enjoy. Unfortunately, when we let them make snow, it ends up all over the place on and off the trails. The snow will begin to fall shortly after the sun sets tonight and continue to come down on and off until sometime Friday night. It's always hard to tell exactly how much snow is expected, but we are hoping for around 10" by the time this storm has finished passing through.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The mountain ops team might not be making snow, but they will get to the mountain quickly after the last chair this afternoon to groom out the mess we made of the trails today and allow this fresh snow to cover a nicely smoothed surface for the best possible conditions tomorrow. Let's hope no one can tell the groomers worked last night by morning due to the amount of snow covering the fresh stripes.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">You might want to change your plans for the next few days and head up to western Maine for fresh snow and fun laps.
