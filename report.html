They stayed off of the trails with active snowmaking, and they worked in some of the new snow from the night before. Broadway and Lower Downdraft both got a fresh groom for that new snow. Our snowmaking team was also out last night, and they made snow on Lazy River, Risky Business, Tourist Trap, and Broadway.
