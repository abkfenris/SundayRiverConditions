Afternoon Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: January 7, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 1:37 PM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>1:35PM Update: 6" of snowfall and counting.</p><p>So far, we have about 6" of snow at the base, and more up top. We had temps in the high teens to low twenties, and the natural frozen precipitation made for a delightful cover on the corduroy. No Sunday blues here!</p><p>The snow is going to keep accumulating through the rest of the afternoon and into tonight. Look out for sunny skies and temps in the mid-twenties tomorrow. Our snowmaking team will be out and about, working on getting new terrain open for next weekend. Our grooming team will be working this new snow into fresh corduroy for tomorrow, and we can expect a similar lineup of groomed and ungroomed terrain.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/special-deals/dash-deals-sale" title="Dash Deals | Sunday River, Maine">Dash Deals</a> will be online for only a few more days.
