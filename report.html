Morning Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: January 20, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 6:32 AM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>We&rsquo;re looking at temps in the single digits up top and the low teens at the base today, so layer up before you head out. There's a chance of snow flurries throughout the day as well, so think snow. We&rsquo;re starting the day off with 714 acres and 17 lifts, and those turns will be worth the cold.</p><p>The Little White Cap Quad will make its season debut this morning, and Green Cheese, Moonstruck, and Starlight all have a fresh groom, thanks to our grooming team. They also took care of all the Merrill Hill terrain and Polaris, as well as our usual lineup. Our snowmaking team resurfaced trails like Lazy River and Broadway, and they kept working on upcoming terrain, as well. Please be aware that there will be active snowmaking on Upper Sunday Punch, Cascades, Jungle Road, and Lower Airglow. Check back here for the most updated lift and terrain status.</p><p>Tonight, we have twilight skiing, live music, fireworks, and a limited-time deal for a single-night stay at the Jordan Hotel. <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/winter-activities/night-skiing" title="Twilight Skiing | Sunday River, Maine">Twilight skiing</a> will be from 3-6:30PM off of the Chondola and the South Ridge Express.
