The grooming team will be out on the hill tonight getting those fresh stripes ready for the morning. Those folks certainly deserve some extra goodies from Santa this year.&nbsp;</p><p>At this time, there is still no beginner terrain available. However, we are happy to share the South Ridge Express and the magic carpets will reopen on Tuesday, December 26. The plan is for the South Ridge Express to start spinning at 10AM with the magic carpets reopening at 8AM. Please note that beginner terrain will only be accessible out of South Ridge, where other parts of the resort will be considered advanced terrain.</p><p>With South Ridge reopening on Tuesday, that means our SnowSports School will be back in action. <span>Offering both day lessons and season-long instructional programs, <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/lessons">check out which lesson</a> works for you.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>We have exciting events happening this week, from <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/fireworks">fireworks</a> to dinner with <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/winter-activities/eddy-and-betty-the-yetis">Eddy and Betty</a>.
