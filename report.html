<h4><strong>April 19, 2023 | 2:12 PM</strong><strong></strong></h4><h4><strong style="font-size: 2em;">Weekend Update</strong></h4><p>Well, folks, it's been one heck of a season, and we couldn't thank you all enough for being a part of it. We still have one more weekend left to get some spring turns in, so let's get into it.</p><p>For this weekend, we'll be ripping it up in Jordan. Skiing and riding will be off of the Jordan 8, with ski-in, ski-out access, and food service available at the Jordan Hotel. The warm temps have definitely taken a lot of snow from our slopes, but word on the block is that the Jordan Bowl is in great shape. Patrol will need to get eyes on trails before the weekend to determine exactly what we'll be able to offer. Once we get the final word, we'll check back in with a final update. Don't forget, Sunday is 0$ tickets for all. Can't really beat that price.</p><p>Keep your eyes here for all of the details, and have a great rest of the week!</p><p>-Team Snow</p><p></p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
