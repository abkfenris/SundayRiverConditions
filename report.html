Morning Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: April 11, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 7:16 AM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>Gooooood morning Sunday River skiers and riders! It's another springy day on the mountain with hero snow top to bottom. Same recipe as yesterday, but we've added T2 and Jim's Whim back onto the list of open terrain. Weather's a bit on the foggy side this morning, but the snow is in great shape with temps right around the 40-degree mark at the base. Throw on a gortex layer and come on out, because it's still going to be a great day.</p><p>This weekend we've got a full slate of activities! Saturday is the crowd favorite <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/pond-a-palooza" title="Pond-A-Palooza">Pond-A-Palooza</a> happening at 11AM in South Ridge. Registration is first come, first served, so if you want to make a splash (so to speak), get there early to secure your spot. Then on Sunday we've got the <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/the-great-tailgate" title="Great Tailgate">Great Tailgate</a> in Barker and our annual <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/free-passholder-lunch" title="Passholder Appreciation Lunch">Passholder Appreciation Lunch</a> in South Ridge.</p><p>Please be cautious while skiing into the South Ridge basin as we've got teams prepping the pond for Pond-A-Palooza. There is a path on the Chondola side of the pond to ski passed it, but please avoid skiing on the side or climbing up the pond for any reason.</p><p><strong>Spring operations schedule:</strong></p><p>Midweek operations will only consist of Jordan, Barker, the Chondola, and Spruce, which means we no longer have true beginner terrain available. Our full Spring operations schedule can be found <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/spring">here</a>.</p><p>Ski-in access to the Grand Summit Hotel is still in play but keep an eye here for updates as the snowpack melts.</p><p>We'll see you out there!</p><p>- Team Snow</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
