<h5>December 7, 2021</h5><p>We&rsquo;ve had a stunning morning of blue skies and sunny slopes! After some variable weather, the Chondola is currently on-hold in order to improve terrain conditions for tomorrow. We are blasting guns across the resort and grooming around the clock to open even more corduroy trails. Check back here tomorrow morning for an update on our available terrain as conditions improve. Locke Mountain Triple, South Ridge Express, Spruce Peak Triple, and Barker Mountain Express are spinning from 9AM-3:45PM tomorrow, with an abundance of groomed trails for your enjoyment.</p><p>All lift tickets need to be <a href="https://shop.sundayriver.com/" strong="" title="online store">purchased online in advance</a>. Have your RFID from last year? You can head straight to the lift! Skier services are available in both the Barker and South Ridge Lodges, as well as shuttle service between these lodges and the hotels while the lifts spin. We are now accepting cashless forms of payment only. Please be sure to have a gift card, resort charge, credit card, or debit card available for on-site purchases.</p><p><strong>Around the Resort</strong></p><p>The South Ridge Food Court is now open, along with the Barker Food Court, Waffle Cabin in Barker Basin, Northern Lights Cafe at the Jordan Hotel, Camp at the Grand Summit Hotel, and Shipyard Brew Haus at White Cap Lodge.
