</h6><p style="color: #696969; font-weight: 900; font-size: 12px;">TUESDAY, JANUARY 26</p><div><p>It's been absolutely gorgeous out there today, with perfect stripes, fantastic conditions, and sunshine across all eight peaks. Keep it up out there and enjoy the endless views, especially over at Jordan Bowl. Ropes dropped on Flow State this morning, our family-friendly boardercross, so head over to test your skills and have some fun. Snowmakers are taking a well deserved break for the next few days and groomers will head out tonight on their normal routes. Mother Nature may be sending an inch or two of fresh snow overnight, so treat yourself to first chair at 9AM tomorrow to cruise around on some new snow.&nbsp;</p><p><span>This winter, your car is your base lodge. We're here to help you make the most of it by</span><a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/gear-up-giveaway"> giving away over $1,000 in gear from YETI </a><span>to help you boot up in the morning, grab a quick lunch between laps, and kick back for apr&egrave;s.</span></p><p><span>There are plenty of food options around the resort for spreading out, but please remember that capacity is limited.

This includes full-day, half-day, beginner, Threedom additional days, and Passholder Friend tickets. We only expect these limits to affect peak dates, but encourage everyone to buy early to ensure access on the dates you want. Season passes, Ikon passes, and lift ticket packs remain direct-to-lift with no restrictions or reservations.<br /><br /></span><span>Fast and contactless lift ticket pickup is available at our PUBs (Pick Up Boxes) at base lodges and hotels. Just scan the barcode at the bottom of your confirmation email and your RFID cards will print with your lift tickets or ticket packs loaded.
