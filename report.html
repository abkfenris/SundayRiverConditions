<p><strong>December 14, 2022 | 7:35 AM</strong></p><p><strong>UPDATE 8:11&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Due to strong winds on hill some lifts will start the morning on wind hold&nbsp;</strong><strong></strong><strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p>Good morning skiers and riders; it's another crisp winter morning here at Sunday River. Clouds are flying across the sky, and snow guns are doing their thing until lifts begin to spin for the day. Our Mountain ops team has been hard at work overnight, as usual, maintaining open terrain and working on getting snow onto new trails for expansion. It will be a nice day today with winter temps and groomed skiing throughout the resort. Hopefully, mother nature will treat us to a fresh blanket of white soon, but until then, our team is doing what they can to create some great skiing and riding for us.</p><p>We've also got some events coming down the pipeline this weekend with <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/winterfest-weekend">Winterfest Weekend</a>, this Saturday, December 17. All in all, this week is shaping up to be a darn good one.</p><p>Don't stop that snow dance!</p><p>-Team Snow</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
