Morning Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: December 13, 2023 </strong></em><strong>| 7:41 AM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>We have another beautiful day ahead of us, folks. Today we have over 200 acres of mostly groomed terrain and eight scheduled lifts, including the Spruce Peak Triple. The forecast has us with partly cloudy skies and temps in the low 30s, so it's a wonderful day to get out there.</p><p>Our snowmaking team was out working last night, blowing snow everywhere they could. Due to temperatures throughout the day today, we can expect to see active snowmaking on open trails including Easy Street, Sundance, and Peak Easy.&nbsp;Our grooming team was also hard at work, grooming our open trails and getting more trails ready for the weekend. We're anticipating ski-out access from the Grand Summit Hotel in a few days.&nbsp;</p><p>Time flies when you're having fun, and we're now less than two weeks away from Christmas.
