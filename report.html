</p><p style="color: #696969; font-weight: 900; font-size: 12px;">FRIDAY, APRIL 2</p><p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline;"><span color="#333333" style="color: #333333;">We woke up this morning to a beautiful sunrise and <strong>snowguns blasting Right Stuff and Sunday Punch</strong>. "In April?!", you ask. Why, yes indeed, and our snowmaking team is hitting the slopes tonight to do it all over again. Our commitment to snow runs so deep, we start with a test in September, build a base in the fall, and keep it up season long even into April. Technically, that's four seasons of running snowguns. Some might say we are obsessed, but that's okay because we're pretty sure you are too.</span></p><p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline;"><span color="#333333" style="color: #333333;">Lifts are scheduled to open at 8AM tomorrow. The groomers will lay stripes on several trails across each peak for corduroy cruising, so hop on first chair and enjoy a full day of carving in the sunshine.
