<h4><strong>January 18, 2023 | 2:00 PM</strong></h4><h2><strong>Afternoon Report</strong><span></span></h2><p>With Temps in the high 30s all day, it was a sure thing that the snow conditions would be soft and playful. The sun was mostly blocked by passing cloud coverage, and winds were gusty at times but relatively calm. Skiing was smooth, and edges gripped turns in the soft snow with ease.</p><p>Snowmakers and snow groomers will be back to work tonight on our eight peaks. They will be blasting more snow on closed terrain in preparation for the upcoming weather. Snowcats will be out as soon as temps drop to groom most of the open terrain and prepare closed trails for potential expansion as the Week goes on.</p><p>Looking into the next couple of days, we are seeing mild temps, partial cloud coverage, and a good chance of snowfall Thursday night and Friday. They estimate around 3-6" of snow in our area, but areas very close to us may also see 6-12". Let's hope the winds are in our favor and can push as much of these snow clouds in our direction in the next couple of days.</p><p>See you on the slopes!<br />-Team Snow</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
