<h4><strong>March 3, 2023 | 7:30 AM</strong><strong></strong></h4><h4><strong style="font-size: 2em;">Morning Report</strong></h4><p>This week flew by, and Friday is already here. Our trails look absolutely fabulous with all the fresh snow we have gotten in the past couple of days. The snowcats took to the slopes last night to lay down a beautiful-looking surface for us this morning. We are sure there are still stashes of fresh snow in the woods and on natural terrain to be found. However, it did get pretty warm yesterday, so the softer fresh snow is in higher parts of the resort. At the same time, down low may be firm, crusty, or heavy in natural areas.</p><p>The sun is already shining bright, and temps will range from the mid-20s to mid-30s as the day progresses. All surfaces will soften up throughout the day, keeping the fun going all the way to last chair.</p><p>It's a beautiful day of fun in the sun today, but tonight might be another story. With snowfall in the forecast from midnight tonight to the end of the day tomorrow, who knows exactly how much snow we will receive? We are excited to see that old man winter hasn't given up yet, but we are anxious to see what he has in store for us.</p><p>More snow is coming!<br />-Team Snow</p><h3>A Note:</h3><p><span>Out of respect for private property, resort homes and condominium owners, we ask that guests keep their beloved pets on their leash throughout the resort. We aim to provide a positive guest experience for all to enjoy while remaining considerate of private property owners adjacent to groomed surfaces. Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
