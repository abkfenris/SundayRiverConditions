<h5>January 27, 2022</h5><p>Good morning Sunday River skiers and riders! Anybody see the sunrise this morning? A good sunrise means a good ski day in my book. Conditions are great at the moment, and groomers lay down stripes all across our eight peaks. With almost 700 acres open, there is plenty of space to explore and find those secret stashes. Today's a bit of a brisk one, so please make sure you're properly layered up for a ski day. Lots of layering options available at <a href="/sunday-river-sports" title="sr sports">Sunday River Sports</a> at South Ridge if you're in need of a new thermal! Hand and foot warmers are your friend, too. Don't let the cold be a deterrent, though - this is what winter in Maine is all about. Embrace those temps and show the snow who's boss. See you at first chair!</p><p>Looking ahead, we're psyched for the forecast this Saturday. Keep those snow dances up, folks. Lets hope Mother Nature is in the mood for a big storm!</p><p>Please note that ski-in access to the Jordan Hotel requires the navigation of intermediate trails to reach Jordan Bowl.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Around the Resort</strong><o:p></o:p><a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/wicked-air-and-apres"></a></p><p><a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/senior-week" target="_blank" title="event details" rel="noopener">Senior Week</a> is here, from January 24 to 28!
