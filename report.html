<h4><strong>January 30, 2023 | 1:10 AM</strong></h4><h4><strong style="font-size: 2em;">Afternoon Report</strong></h4><p>Conditions definitely softened up as the day went on with temps hitting the low 30s. Tomorrow looks to be a slightly different story with temperatures. Plan for a morning in the high teens to low 20s and not a ton of movement from there. It might be a good day for an extra break at the <a href="/resort-dining/coffee-hound" title="Coffee Hound">Coffee Hound</a> or at <a href="/resort-dining/northern-lights" title="Northern Lights Cafe">Northern Lights Cafe</a>.</p><p>Aside from that, our snowmaking team is continuing to blast on a handful of trails and our grooming team will be putting stripes up and down the mountain. All in all, things are looking pretty good.</p><p>&nbsp;See you out there!<br />-Team Snow</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
