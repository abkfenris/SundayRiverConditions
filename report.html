<h4><strong>March 31, 2023 | 7:32 AM</strong><strong></strong></h4><h4><strong style="font-size: 2em;">Morning Report</strong></h4><p>If you can't believe that tomorrow is April, you're not alone. But here we are, and we're sending March out with an absolutely beautiful day. The sun is shining, and cool temps overnight will yield to warmer temps throughout the day. Thanks to some firmer snow overnight, the grooming team had another great night and laid down fresh cord that should ski beautifully until it softens up around mid-day.&nbsp;</p><p>The forecast this weekend has been tricky, but believe it or not, we may pick up a sneaky 2-4" of snow overnight, especially up at the higher peaks. We're not expecting a powder day, but fresh snow and warm temps tomorrow will make for some amazing spring skiing, just in time for <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/spring-fest-weekend.xml">Spring Fest Weekend</a>! We've got quite the line-up coming to you for a full weekend of fun. Due to the weather, we'll be moving the party upstairs in White Cap lodge.&nbsp;</p><p>It should be a great weekend of fun, skiing, and parties!</p><p>See you out there!<br />-Team Snow</p><h4>A Note:</h4><p>Spring brings with it some of the best conditions of the year, but also the most variable condition. Please note that trail conditions may vary and change rapidly throughout the day.</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
