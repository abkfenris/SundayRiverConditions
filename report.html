<h4><strong>January 12, 2023 | 7:30 AM</strong></h4><h2><strong>Morning Update</strong><span></span></h2><p>Good morning, and happy Thursday. Last night's cold temps were exactly what our mountain ops team was looking for. They took to the mountain last night, making snow all over White Cap and parts of Barker. Middle Sunday Punch will be the only active snowmaking area on open terrain today. As the night went on, snowcats were able to spread out over the resort and groom fresh stripes onto all open trails except for Lost Princess. With over 350 Acres of open terrain and 12 lifts providing access, there is a lot to see and explore out here.</p><p>The weather looks pretty mild throughout the day with calm winds, temperatures reaching mid-20s, and possible snowfall in the afternoon and into the night. Temps seem to be on the rise tomorrow, but it's hard telling, not knowing what will happen in the next 24 hours. Let's see what Mother Nature has planned for us in the next couple of days and hope for the best. We are confident that no matter what Mother Nature throws at us, our mountain ops team will be able to recover and bounce back like they always do.</p><p>If your staying around for the week with your little rippers make sure to head to the Juniper Room at the Jordan Hotel tonight for a <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/january-magic-show">Magic Show with Phil Smith</a></p><p><strong>Please note:</strong> There is currently no beginner terrain into and out of the Grand Summit Hotel.</p><p>See you on the slopes!</p><p>-Team Snow</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
