Tickets are sold out for today, but still available for Sunday.</h6><p style="color: #696969; font-weight: 900; font-size: 12px;">SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 6</p><div><p>After an absolutely beautiful week, we're kicking off the weekend with perfectly pressed corduroy, fun naturals, and powder stashes still to be found. There are over 800 acres to explore out there, so make your way around the mountain. Head to some of our favorite groomers like Obsession, Risky Business, Northern Lights, and Rogue Angel. For some untouched snow, head to Locke Mountain and Oz. If you're just learning, stick to the terrain on South Ridge and off of the Little White Cap Quad.&nbsp;It's a first chair kind of day, so hop on lifts at 8AM to enjoy these amazing conditions and winter bliss.</p><p>Keep it up until 6:30PM with <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/winter-activities/night-skiing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twilight Skiing</a>&nbsp;and end your night on the slopes with a fireworks show at 7PM at South Ridge. The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/freeheelers-demo-tour" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FreeHeeler's Demo Tour</a> will start at 8AM this morning over at White Cap base area, bringing the latest telemark gear from top brands to demo, and offering clinics for those who want to learn.&nbsp;</p><p>Lift tickets are sold out for today and are filling up quickly for Sunday so make sure to buy yours soon. Don't forget that&nbsp;resort lodging guests can always purchase tickets at the front desks of their property, even when we're sold out.&nbsp;</p><p>When enjoying the snow out there, please keep in mind lift lines may appear longer than they actually are. Due to social distancing in and between lines, plus guests only riding with their traveling group, lines look longer than we're used to seeing, but move rather quickly.&nbsp;</p><p><span>Please note we are&nbsp;</span><a title="Online Store" href="https://shop.sundayriver.com/s/lift-tickets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>requiring online lift ticket purchase</strong></a><span>&nbsp;and setting </span><strong>limits on the number of tickets</strong><span>&nbsp;sold for each day. This includes full-day, half-day, beginner, Threedom additional days, and Passholder Friend tickets. We only expect these limits to affect peak dates, but encourage everyone to buy early to ensure access on the dates you want. Season passes, Ikon passes, and lift ticket packs remain direct-to-lift with no restrictions or reservations.</span></p><p><span>Fast and contactless lift ticket pickup is available at our PUBs (Pick Up Boxes) at base lodges and hotels. Just scan the barcode at the bottom of your confirmation email and your RFID cards will print with your lift tickets or ticket packs loaded. For best results turn off dark mode on your phone if you use it and avoid email apps that use dark backgrounds.</span></p><p><span>Please remember to take a self-administered </span><a title="Health Screening" href="https://www.sundayriver.com/covid">Health Screening</a><span> and visit our&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/covid">COVID Winter Guide</a><span>&nbsp;before each trip to stay up-to-date on safety protocols and state guidelines.</span></p><p>Masks up!</p><p><span>Team Snow</span></p></div><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
