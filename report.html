<h5>December 11, 2021</h5><p>Welcome to over 200 acres of skiable terrain! We are starting this weekend off on the right ski boot, opening Jibe, Heat's On, Starlight, and Road Runner, all groomed for you to shred. Today White Cap Quad is opening for the first time this season, accompanying Barker, South Ridge, Locke, the Chondola, and Spruce lifts all spinning from 8AM-3:45PM.
