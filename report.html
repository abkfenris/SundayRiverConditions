<h4><strong>January 11, 2023 | 7:35 AM</strong></h4><h2><strong>Morning Update</strong><span></span></h2><p>As the sun rises over the mountains, there is nothing but blue skies and clouds of snowmaking. It's a brisk five degrees this morning, but the sun is shining bright and should get up to the mid-20s by mid-day.</p><p>Our Mountain Ops team took advantage of these cold temps last night and got back to it. They turned on over 150 Snow guns, making snow on closed terrain throughout the resort on trails such as Lost Princess, Cowardly Lion, White Heat, Moonstruck, Starlight, Green Cheese, Assumption, and Vortex. With this much active snow making, we hope to open these trails very soon. Please note that Lower Sunday Punch will be the only open trail with active snowmaking today.</p><p>The snowcats got to it early in the night and groomed out most of the mountain, including American Express, Obsession, and Heats off.</p><p><a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/kids-week">Kids' Week</a> continues with a<a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/january-fire-dancer"> Fire Dancing Performance</a> and Fireworks later tonight slope side at South Ridge. Make sure to check out everything we have gong on this week for your little rippers to enjoy.</p><p>If you like fast groomers, brisk temps, and bright clear skies, then today is just the day you are looking for.</p><p><strong>Please note:</strong> There is currently no beginner terrain into and out of the Grand Summit Hotel.</p><p>See you on the slopes!</p><p>-Team Snow</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
