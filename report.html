Morning Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: April 12, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 7:30AM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>Hey there! So, here's the scoop on the mountain conditions today. It looks like we're in for some steady rain throughout the day, so make sure you're geared up and have an extra change of clothes. The good news is that the wind has not picked up yet this morning, but it is expected to join us later in the day.</p><p>The grooming team adjusted their schedule last night, meaning that there were a few trails that didn't get their usual TLC. For today, Jibe, Heats On, T2, Monday Mourning, Cascades, Excaliber, Rogue, Grand Rapids, Risky to Lazy, and Amex to Rough Draft, will be ungroomed. Please keep this in mind as you plan out your runs today.&nbsp;</p><p>This weekend we've got a full slate of activities! Tomorrow is the crowd favorite, <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/pond-a-palooza" title="Pond-A-Palooza">Pond-A-Palooza</a>, starting at 11AM in South Ridge. Registration is first come, first served, so if you want to make a splash (so to speak), get there early to secure your spot. Then on Sunday, we've got the <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/the-great-tailgate" title="Great Tailgate">Great Tailgate</a> in Barker and our annual <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/free-passholder-lunch" title="Passholder Appreciation Lunch">Passholder Appreciation Lunch</a> in South Ridge.</p><p>Please be cautious while skiing into the South Ridge basin as we've got teams prepping the pond for Pond-A-Palooza. There is a path on the Chondola side of the pond to ski passed it, but please avoid skiing on the side or climbing up the pond for any reason.</p><p><strong>Spring operations schedule:</strong></p><p>Midweek operations will only consist of Jordan, Barker, the Chondola, and Spruce, which means we no longer have true beginner terrain available. Our full Spring operations schedule can be found <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/spring">here</a>.</p><p>As we move into the final days of the season, please note that the Jordan Hotel is still ski-in/ski-out, but the Grand Summit is just ski-in.</p><p>We'll see you out there!</p><p>- Team Snow</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
