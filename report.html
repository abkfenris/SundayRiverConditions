</h6><p style="color: #696969; font-weight: 900; font-size: 12px;">SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 7</p><div><p><strong>We are now 100% open!</strong>&nbsp;Conditions have been fantastic with 15&rdquo; of new snow in the last week, plus, it just started snowing again. The weekend might be coming to an end, but it looks like we have a stellar week ahead. This new snow will be a great refresh on the slopes, so don't stay up too late watching the Super Bowl. Hop on first chair at 9AM tomorrow for fresh powder stashes and pristine corduroy.&nbsp;</p><p>When enjoying the snow out there, please keep in mind lift lines may appear longer than they actually are. Due to social distancing in and between lines, plus guests only riding with their traveling group, lines look longer than we're used to seeing, but move rather quickly.&nbsp;</p><p><span>Please note we are&nbsp;</span><a title="Online Store" href="https://shop.sundayriver.com/s/lift-tickets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>requiring online lift ticket purchase</strong></a><span>&nbsp;and setting </span><strong>limits on the number of tickets</strong><span>&nbsp;sold for each day. This includes full-day, half-day, beginner, Threedom additional days, and Passholder Friend tickets. We only expect these limits to affect peak dates, but encourage everyone to buy early to ensure access on the dates you want. Season passes, Ikon passes, and lift ticket packs remain direct-to-lift with no restrictions or reservations.</span></p><p><span>Fast and contactless lift ticket pickup is available at our PUBs (Pick Up Boxes) at base lodges and hotels. Just scan the barcode at the bottom of your confirmation email and your RFID cards will print with your lift tickets or ticket packs loaded. For best results turn off dark mode on your phone if you use it and avoid email apps that use dark backgrounds.</span></p><p><span>Please remember to take a self-administered </span><a title="Health Screening" href="https://www.sundayriver.com/covid">Health Screening</a><span> and visit our&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/covid">COVID Winter Guide</a><span>&nbsp;before each trip to stay up-to-date on safety protocols and state guidelines.</span></p><p>See you tomorrow!</p><p><span>Team Snow</span></p></div><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
