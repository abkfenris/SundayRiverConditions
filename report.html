<h4><strong>March 18, 2023 | 6:30 AM</strong><strong></strong></h4><h4><strong style="font-size: 2em;">Morning Report</strong></h4><p>Saturday has arrived, and the weekend is finally here. Last night's weather was quite strange as clouds passed by, temps varied, and precipitation fell sporadically. Groomers reported being quite pleased with their job last night and the product they had prepared for us this morning. All things considered, we have dodged another dreaded freeze, and the mountain should be smooth and soft for the most part.</p><p>It's going to be another fantastic day here in the heart of western Maine. The sun will shine bright in what is hopefully a bluebird sky. Winds are forecasted to remain calm and temps warm up to the mid-40s by lunchtime.</p><p>We hope you can get yourself and a few buddies up to the mountains this weekend to enjoy comfortable temps, great skiing, and plenty of open terrain.
