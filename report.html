Afternoon Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: January 18, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 1:39 PM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>It was a chilly one out there today, with temps in the high teens, variable winds, and sunny skies. The turns were great, the snow was soft, and any corduroy left by this afternoon was buttery smooth. We opened 20 additional acres throughout the day, putting us at 690 acres of skiable terrain. We're certainly ready to do it all again tomorrow.&nbsp;</p><p>Tonight, our snowmaking team will continue their work on Little White Cap, and we're anticipating opening that lift this weekend. They'll continue making snow on T72 and Rocking Chair, as well. Our grooming team will take care of the usual trails, with the potential addition of Merill Hill. We're hoping to open more terrain on Merrill Hill this weekend, as well. Wonderland will open again with more features, and Starlight will have some park features by this weekend.&nbsp;</p><p>Searching for a quick weekend getaway? Look no further.
