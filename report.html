<p><strong>March 12, 2022</strong></p><p>Incoming snow on the slopes! Mother Nature is ready to let the flurries fly on nearly 700 acres of open terrain this morning. Forecasts are calling for a range of totals, and we could see up to 6-14" on our peaks as we ski into tonight. Catch first chair at 8AM to carve into more than 80 corduroy trails before fresh flakes cover the terrain. Then take powdery turns across 8 peaks until 4PM, and head over to North Peak for <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/winter-activities/night-skiing.xml" title="Twilight Skiing">Twilight Skiing</a> until 6:30PM as the snow falls. Please note as the snow picks up later today, winds may impact lift operations this afternoon going into tonight. Since winds are a possibility, we've removed the cabins off the Chondola for the weekend.
