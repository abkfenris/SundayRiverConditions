<h4><strong>March 25, 2023 | 6:30 AM</strong><strong></strong></h4><h4><strong style="font-size: 2em;">Morning Report</strong></h4><p>Good morning! The weekend has arrived! It was great to see the temps drop a little last night, letting the snowpack dry out and giving the groomers good snow conditions to work with. They got to the slopes and did their things as always, grooming the trails smooth and drawing those corduroy stripes again. Natural terrain might be fairly firm this morning. Our ski patrollers are hitting the trails early to inspect the woods and natural trails to see if they are safe to open. We will run all 13-weekday lifts plus the Merrill Hill Triple today, accessing all eight peaks and over 800 acres of open terrain.</p><p>As for the weather today, well, it's certainly looking interesting. As the day goes on, clouds will pass, and temps will range in the low 30s. There is a strong chance of snow showers and heavy snowfall by early afternoon and going into the night. We are seeing forecasts of 3-6" of snow in our area; some even say 6"+ by tomorrow morning. With snow this late in the season, the conditions will vary depending on your location on the mountain. Up top might be light and smooth, but it could get heavy and wet at the bottom.</p><p>Today marks the final day of <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/winter-activities/night-skiing" title="Twilight Skiing">Twilight Skiing</a>, so if you want some after-hours turns, this is your last chance.
