LIFT TICKETS ARE SOLD OUT FOR SATURDAY, JANUARY 22.</h6><p style="color: #696969; font-weight: 900; font-size: 12px;">FRIDAY, JANUARY 22</p><p>Happy Friday! It's been a beautiful day of skiing and riding on over 100 open trails across eight peaks, and the extra inch of snow made it that much better. Thanks to the hard work from our snowmakers, groomers, and some help from Mother Nature, conditions have been fantastic. Ropes dropped on Shockwave, North Woods, and Absolutely today for the first time this season. Keep it up out there and continue shredding until 6:30PM with twilight skiing. Groomers will head out on their normal routes overnight to press corduroy for tomorrow's turns. The flakes are currently falling and we're expecting a couple of inches of snowfall by tomorrow, so come back for a full day of carving on the fresh pressed snow.</p><p>Please note that we are anticipating some wind for tomorrow. Our team will be taking off the Chondola cabins for a better chance of running the lift. Continue to check lift status for updates.&nbsp;</p><div>This winter, your car is your base lodge. We're here to help you make the most of it by<a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/gear-up-giveaway"> giving away over $1,000 in gear from YETI </a>to help you boot up in the morning, grab a quick lunch between laps, and kick back for apr&egrave;s.</div><div></div><div>Dreaming of a wintery getaway?
