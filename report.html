Morning Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: March 24, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 6:35 AM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>When Mother Nature delivers, she delivers.&nbsp;</p><p>We received almost 2' of snow yesterday during our open hours, and over a foot fell through the night. That brings us to a whopping 36" of snow for this March snowstorm. It's the fluffy stuff, too.&nbsp;</p><p>Some wind picked up last night, as it does at the tail end of storms. We're experiencing some serious snow drifts this morning as we deal with this wind. We are anticipating wind holds early this morning, so take your time with your morning coffee before you head to the mountain. The wind is forecasted to die down by this afternoon, and today will be well worth the wait. For the most up-to-date information, check out the lift and trail status below.&nbsp;</p><p>Our grooming team was out through the night, and they turned this new powder into some amazing corduroy. They turned the powder into some amazing corduroy on all of our beginner terrain last night, including all of the trails at South Ridge, Little White Cap, and Merrill Hill. Our grooming team also laid stripes on our intermediate and advanced terrain, but they kept a narrow groom last night, meaning there's still plenty of powder on the sides of the trails. For some all-natural skiing, try some of the glades like Blind Ambition, Hard Ball, and Wizard's Gulch.&nbsp;</p><p>Thinking about a season pass for next year?
