</h6><p style="color: #696969; font-weight: 900; font-size: 12px;">SUNDAY, JANUARY 10</p><p>It is going to be a beautiful sunny Sunday on the slopes today. You can expect perfect packed powdery corduroy to cover the slopes across all eight peaks along with a few fresh snowmaking trails. Thanks to all the hard work from our Mountain Operations team, we have all the beginner terrain open off of Little White Cap Quad such as Moonstruck, Green Cheese, and Starlight. Plus, ropes dropped on Airglow, but please note it is ungroomed with fresh snowmaking and fun whales. Snowmakers also fired up snow guns in the wonderful land of Oz on trails like Cowardly Lion and Lost Princess. If you are still learning how to ski today, start the day at our Sundance Surface lifts, these will take you a little way up the slope without even having to leave the ground. If you are a beginner but beyond that, Broadway off of South Ridge Express and the new open terrain off of Little White Cap Quad are the best places for you to spend the day.</p><p>Lifts start spinning at 8AM today. Both of our resort hotels are ski-in/ski-out and with the opening of the Little White Cap Quad, the Grand Summit Hotel will now have beginner terrain access.&nbsp;The best way to ski-back to the Jordan Hotel for beginners is to ski Sensation and take the Jordan Mountain Double due to active snowmaking off of Aurora.</p><p>Looking ahead, we're pushing to add even more terrain for the three-day Martin Luther King Jr. weekend and offering <a href="/special-deals/mlk-lodging" title="MLK lodging sale">20% off resort lodging</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>All three base areas lodges are open with full services at South Ridge including season pass pickup, shopping, and rentals. There are several additional&nbsp;<a style="font-style: inherit;" href="https://www.sundayriver.com/river-guide"><strong>dining options</strong></a>&nbsp;around the resort, but please keep in mind that capacity is limited.</p><p><strong>Lift ticket pick up</strong>: Fast and contactless ticket pickup is available at our PUBs (Pick Up Boxes) throughout the resort. Just scan the barcode at the bottom of your confirmation email and your RFID cards will print with your lift tickets or ticket packs loaded. Don't forget to turn off dark mode on your phone if you use it.&nbsp;</p><p>As we continue to adjust resort operations to prioritize the safety of our guests, we are now&nbsp;<a title="Online Store" href="https://shop.sundayriver.com/s/lift-tickets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>requiring online lift ticket purchase</strong></a> or reloading and setting <strong>limits on the number of tickets sold</strong> for each day. This includes day, half-day, beginner, Threedom additional days, and Passholder Friend tickets. We only expect these limits to come into play on peak dates, but encourage everyone to buy early to ensure access on the dates you want. Season passes, Ikon passes, and lift ticket packs remain direct-to-lift with no restrictions or reservations.</p><p>Lastly, please remember to check our <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/covid">COVID Winter Guide</a> before each visit to make a plan for your day and stay on top of any potential changes. We&rsquo;re in this together and need your help.</p><p>Carve on!</p><p>- Team Snow</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
