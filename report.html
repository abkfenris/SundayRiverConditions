Afternoon Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: March 22, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 2:39 PM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>Sunshine and blue skies for this Friday afternoon, and what a wonderful way to head into the weekend. The winds of this morning have died down, and all of the lifts are off wind hold and back up spinning. The Chondola and the South Ridge Express will spin into the night for our last Friday of twilight skiing for the season. Snowflakes should start falling later tonight, and we're expecting continuous snowfall throughout the day tomorrow.&nbsp;</p><p>Our snowmaking team will be blowing snow on Excalibur tonight, and they're leaving the rest to Mother Nature. It will come offline tomorrow morning, and Excalibur will not be groomed. Our grooming team will groom all of the same trails as last night, except Excalibur, and they'll be adding Merrill Hill, Lazy River, Risky Business, Tourist Trap, and Three Mile Trail to the list. South Ridge, North Peak, and Little White Cap will all be groomed last in order to pack down as much powder as possible. For you powder hounds out there, head to our more intermediate and advanced terrain, which will all be getting an earlier groom.</p><p>Thinking about a season pass for next year?
