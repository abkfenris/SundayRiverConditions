<h4><strong>February 26, 2023 | 6:25 AM</strong></h4><h4><strong style="font-size: 2em;">Morning Report</strong></h4><p>Good morning skiers and riders, and happy Sunday. We look forward to beautiful groomed conditions today as our team is preparing the mountain for the morning. Groomers did their thing last night, smoothing out most of the usual trails. Lifts are beginning to spin, and our team is getting into positions for a great day.</p><p>Temps are definitely chilly this morning, so pack some extra layers to keep you warm and take a few lodge breaks throughout the day. We are starting this morning at around 0 degrees, but things will warm up quickly to the mid-teens for the rest of the day. Clouds should be passing by, and maybe even some snowfall later to add to the wintery mood.</p><p>We hope you have enjoyed another great Presidents' week and have the energy today to get on the hill for more smooth runs on our 8 peaks.</p><p>See you next time!<br />-Team Snow</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
