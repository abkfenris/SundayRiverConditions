<h4><strong>April 4, 2023 | 7:35 AM</strong><strong></strong></h4><h4><strong style="font-size: 2em;">Morning Report</strong></h4><p>It's crazy to think that this is the second to last Tuesday of the season. We've got a great one on tap today, with warm temps dominating the day. It's definitely starting to feel like spring in Western Maine. The grooming team continued their resurfacing efforts last night and had an excellent night on the hill. Conditions this morning will be slightly firm, but a lot of fun, and will quickly yield to the classic spring skiing you'd expect this time of year.</p><p>Please note that in order to access condos off of Ridge Run, you must<strong> take Dream Maker and then turn onto Ridge Run</strong>. We have operations on 3D cutting over the Ridge Run road and cannot have thru-traffic.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;We have a lot still going on here at Sunday River; as we wind down the season be sure to check out our <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/spring.xml" title="Spring Operation Schedule">Spring operations schedule</a> and end-of-season<a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events"> events</a>. Next on the list are Pond-A-Palooza, the second spring concert series on Saturday, an Easter egg hunt, and Passholder lunch on Sunday.&nbsp;</p><p>See you out there!<br />-Team Snow</p><h4>A Note:</h4><p>Spring brings with it some of the best conditions of the year, but also the most variable condition. Please note that trail conditions may vary and change rapidly throughout the day.</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
