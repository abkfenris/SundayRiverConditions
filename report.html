<p><strong>February 28, 2022</strong></p><p>Daily snowmaking and sunshine on the slopes! Since yesterday, snowguns are blasting on Ecstasy, Cascades, and Obsession to make piles of fresh powder. After groomers put down a great base last night, snowmakers are adding Lazy River, Tourist Trap, and Lower Starlight to their growing list of trails for today. Groomers pushed out massive snowmaking hills on Right Stuff to make stunning corduroy for you to carve. Catch 9AM first chair and explore more than 80 trails with stripes, or enjoy all-natural terrain including Ecstasy, Obsession, and Cascades. Options await you with 115 glades and trails to start the day, spanning across 721 acres of open terrain. A few forecasted flurries are rolling into town to start the new week, so please keep an eye on the lift and trail status as winds may impact lifts. Ski away your Monday blues on piles of freshly made snow!</p><p><strong>Around the Resort</strong></p><p><span>Check out the <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/red-bull-slide-in-tour.xml" title="Red Bull Slide-In Tour">Red Bull Slide-In Tour</a> March 12 to celebrate snowboard culture in the East!
