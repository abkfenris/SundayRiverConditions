<h5>January 12, 2022</h5><p><span>We all owe Mother Nature a huge thank you for finally allowing the temperatures to hit double digits. The weather is looking like it will stay consistent overnight which will allow for some snowmaking on White Cap and Barker Mountain. The groomers are coming out in full force tonight too, so you all have some fresh corduroy to shred tomorrow morning. Every day we will continue to expand available terrain to make sure everyone can find their happy place.</span></p><p>The White Heat Quad and the Aurora Quad will not spin tomorrow but will be back on Friday.
