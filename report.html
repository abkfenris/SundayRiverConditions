Over the weekend our snowmakers fired up the snow guns on Lower Sunday Punch and Right Stuff, so you will want to put those high on your list, along with Monday Mourning and American Express. Groomers took to the slopes last night and smoothed out open terrain for some fun mid-week laps. The Barker Mountain Express and Spruce Peak Triple will start spinning at 9AM.&nbsp;Hit the slopes early to enjoy some carving in the soft corduroy and stick around for some corn snow this afternoon.&nbsp;</span></p><p style="font-style: inherit;">With operations open daily through April 24, there is plenty of ski season ahead.
