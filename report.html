</h6><p style="color: #696969; font-weight: 900; font-size: 12px;">TUESDAY, JANUARY 26</p><div><p>Afer a beautiful Monday on the mountain, we're getting to do it all over again today with sunshine, perfect stripes, and fantastic conditions across all eight peaks. Head to trails like American Express, Excalibur, and Northern Lights for some perfect morning carving. Keep an eye out for ropes dropping on Flow State, our family-friendly boardercross, as our team works on the finishing touches this morning. Snowmaking has come offline on Quantum Leap and our snowmakers are taking a well deserved break for the next few days. Treat yourself to first chair at 9AM to carve across the carpet of corduroy and explore over 100 open trails.&nbsp;</p><p><span>This winter, your car is your base lodge. We're here to help you make the most of it by</span><a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/gear-up-giveaway"> giving away over $1,000 in gear from YETI </a><span>to help you boot up in the morning, grab a quick lunch between laps, and kick back for apr&egrave;s.</span></p><p><span>There are plenty of food options around the resort for spreading out, but please remember that capacity is limited.

This includes full-day, half-day, beginner, Threedom additional days, and Passholder Friend tickets.

Just scan the barcode at the bottom of your confirmation email and your RFID cards will print with your lift tickets or ticket packs loaded.
