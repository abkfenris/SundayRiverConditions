Morning Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: March 10, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 6:35 AM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>Snow alert! We have about 8 inches of new snow here in South Ridge, and it's still coming down strong. Thank you, Mother Nature. Bring your powder skis and get on out there for this mid-March snowstorm.</p><p>It's currently in the mid-twenties up top and low thirties at the base, and it will warm up a little throughout the day. Our grooming team was out through the night last night, and they laid stripes on 70 trails. They finished up the green and blue terrain last, so that new snow should be packed into fresh corduroy on our green trails. If you want some powder stashes, head to our advanced terrain, which was mostly groomed before the snow started. Our snowmaking team took the night off to let Mother Nature work her magic, and they'll be back Monday night. Our terrain parks were also groomed out last night.&nbsp;</p><p>Be sure to check out our <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events" title="Events | Sunday River, Maine">events calendar</a> for a full list of events across the mountain.
