<h4><strong>February 18, 2023 | 1:45 PM</strong></h4><h4><strong style="font-size: 2em;">Afternoon Report</strong></h4><p>Today was firm and fast indeed, but with bright skies and calm winds, it was a great day to explore our eight peaks. Woods and ungroomed terrain remained closed, but plenty of groomers and all of our lifts were open. Temps stayed cold, allowing us to make fresh snow on a few trails that were in need of softer surfaces.</p><p>Going into the night, our team will turn on more snowguns and get to the slopes to groom the corduroy back onto the trails. They will leave snowmaking trails alone and get to a few closed trails to smooth out and resurface. Tomorrow should range in temps around the mid-20s. Clouds should pass by throughout the day, keeping the sun from softening the conditions too much making our trails firm and fast for another day.</p><p>Remember to check out everything we have happening this week for Presidents' Week. From Twilight Skiing all week long to bands, fire works, and live entertainment, there is always something going on during the holidays here at Sunday River. We are seeing some good signs of snowfall at some point later next week, which is a great reason to take advantage of our<a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/resort-lodging"> one-night stays</a> now available for Presidents' Week.
