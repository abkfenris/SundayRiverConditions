Morning Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: March 7, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 7:35 AM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>There's no two ways about it, folks; it's a wet one out there. Grab your raincoat before heading to the mountain, and take advantage of those bubbles today on the Barker 6 and the Jordan 8. The snow is soft and playful, and temps are in the mid-thirties up top and low forties down at the base. This morning's rain is forecasted to stop by noon, so savor that morning coffee and take your time getting to the mountain today.&nbsp;</p><p>Similar to last night, our grooming team had a limited grooming plan in order to preserve the snowpack. Our top-to-bottom groomers today include Cascades, Lazy River, Broadway, Sundance, and Lollapalooza. Kansas and Road Runner are also groomed. For a full list of groomed terrain, check out the trail status below. Please note that Green Cheese and Moonstruck will be closed today, so there will be no beginner terrain off of the Little White Cap Quad. For beginner terrain, we recommend heading over to South Ridge.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>While this weather pattern is certainly not ideal, we are in great shape for excellent end-of-March and April skiing, thanks to our dedicated snowmaking and grooming teams. Temps look like they'll be cooling down over the next few days, and there might be some snow in the near future.&nbsp;</p><p><span>Be sure to check out the <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events">events calendar</a> for the lineup of activities and performances throughout the rest of the month.
