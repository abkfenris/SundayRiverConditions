Yes, please.&nbsp;</p><p>Mother Nature delivered last night, and we couldn't be happier. The snow came earlier in the evening, stopping around 10PM, which gave our grooming team time to work their magic on it. Our beginner and intermediate terrain has fresh, powdery corduroy, and our advanced terrain has some untouched snow. Whichever you choose, you can't go wrong.&nbsp;</p><p>Our snowmakers teamed up with the storm, and they made snow across the resort. They'll continue making snow throughout the day as temperatures stay low, and we'll have active snowmaking on Rogue Angel, Tourist Trap,&nbsp; and Broadway. Our grooming team laid stripes on the steeper terrain first, so that corduroy will be under a couple of inches of snow. They added Three Mile Trail to their list last night, and Ridge Run is scheduled to open today, groomed and all.</p><p>Have you always wished you could ride in a snowcat?
