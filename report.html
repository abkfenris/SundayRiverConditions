</h6><p style="color: #696969; font-weight: 900; font-size: 12px;">TUESDAY, JANUARY 12</p><p>We kicked off Tuesday's turns with the debut of Paradigm and Black Hole and ropes later dropped on Downdraft. Groomers will head out tonight on their normal routes, but will add 3D to their list. Snowmaking temps should come back tonight and our team will be out on Salvation, Cowardly Lion, Lost Princess, Rocking Chair, Wildfire, and Vortex. The next few days look awesome, so take some time to enjoy the midweek bliss and hop on first chair at 9AM.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Looking ahead, we're pushing to add even more terrain for the three-day Martin Luther King Jr. weekend. Plus, we are currently offering <a href="/special-deals/mlk-lodging" title="MLK lodging sale">20% off resort lodging</a>&nbsp;for the long weekend with both of our slopeside hotels ski-in/ski-out. Please note that we are experiencing high inquiry volume in our call center and guest services so we recommending using our&nbsp;<a href="/booklodging" target="_blank" title="Book Lodging " rel="noopener">online booking engine</a> for lodging quotes and booking and our<a href="https://shop.sundayriver.com/s/lift-tickets/"> lift ticket store</a>&nbsp;for all ticket and pass purchases. Remember that a limited number of tickets are available each day so please buy in advance to ensure access on weekends and holidays.</p><p>All three base areas lodges are open with parking and basic skier services, and South Ridge Lodge also offers season pass pickup, shopping, tuning, rentals, and SnowSports school. There are several&nbsp;<a style="font-style: inherit;" href="https://www.sundayriver.com/resort-dining"><strong>dining options</strong></a>&nbsp;available around the resort, but please keep in mind that capacity is limited and check weekly schedules on this site or our app.</p><p><strong>Lift ticket pick up</strong>: Fast and contactless ticket pickup is available at our PUBs (Pick Up Boxes) throughout the resort. Just scan the barcode at the bottom of your confirmation email and your RFID cards will print with your lift tickets or ticket packs loaded. For best results turn off dark mode on your phone if you use it and avoid email apps that use dark backgrounds.</p><p>Please remember that we are&nbsp;<a title="Online Store" href="https://shop.sundayriver.com/s/lift-tickets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>requiring online lift ticket purchase</strong></a> or reloading this season and setting <strong>limits on the number of tickets sold</strong> for each day. This includes day, half-day, beginner, Threedom additional days, and Passholder Friend tickets. We only expect these limits to come into play on peak dates, but encourage everyone to buy early to ensure access on the dates you want. Season passes, Ikon passes, and lift ticket packs remain direct-to-lift with no restrictions or reservations.</p><p>Lastly, please remember to check our <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/covid">COVID Winter Guide</a> before each visit to make a plan for your day and stay on top of any potential changes. We&rsquo;re in this together and need your help.</p><p>Masks up!</p><p>- Team Snow</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
