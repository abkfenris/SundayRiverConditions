<h5>January 7, 2022</h5><p>The snow is here, and we're in for a fun day on the slopes with up to 3" of snow in the forecast. The snowcats prepared for Mother Nature's arrival by putting fresh stripes down on 65 trails overnight, while the snowmakers gave us a head start with new snow on Rocking Chair, Salvation, Wildfire, Vortex, Paradigm, Southpaw, and Airglow. We're expecting light snowfall throughout the day with temperatures in the mid-20s. Lifts are spinning from 9AM until 6:30PM for <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/winter-activities/night-skiing" target="_blank" title="activity" rel="noopener">Twilight Skiing</a>!&nbsp;</p><p>Both hotels are now ski-in/ski-out for your convenience.
