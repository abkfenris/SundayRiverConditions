Upon further evaluation, the Chondola will remain closed Sunday, December 31, but is tentatively planned to re-open on Monday, January 1.</p><p>Looking ahead, our goal is to be skiing in the Jordan Bowl on Friday, January 5. This will include ski-in, ski-out access to the Jordan Hotel. The Alpeniglu is also scheduled to re-open on Friday, as well as the Outpost, for convenient slopeside snacks and beverages. Snowmaking temps will be crucial to meeting this goal, but the forecast looks promising, and our snowmakers are ready to get back to what they do best.</p><p>Think cold, and we'll see you out there!</p><p>- Team Snow</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
