<h5>January 2, 2022</h5><p>We are starting 2022 with a forecast featuring 1-3" of fresh snow! This early afternoon and into tonight, we are looking forward to flurries falling on 8 peaks. Today we have 77 open trails across 423 acres for you to shred all day. Groomers put down stripes last night and into this morning, so you can carve into fresh corduroy. Lifts are spinning from 8AM-3:45PM, so get in as many turns as you want today. An abundance of options awaits you, on the most open terrain in the East!</p><p>Both hotels are now ski-in/ski-out for your convenience. To ski into the Grand Summit Hotel via green terrain, take Little White Cap Quad and ski down Moonstruck via Green Cheese. To access the Jordan Hotel via green terrain, please take the Jordan Mountain Double from Aurora Basin, to ride the Jordan Bowl Express, and ski Lollapalooza. At this time, all other green trails into the Jordan Hotel are temporarily considered advanced terrain.<o:p></o:p></p><p><strong>Around the Resort</strong><o:p></o:p></p><p>Select services, such as lessons and rental equipment, may be limited or sold out due to the holiday vacation week.
