<h4><strong>January 17, 2023 | 1:16 PM</strong></h4><h2><strong>Afternoon Report</strong><span></span></h2><p>What an absolutely gorgeous day here in Western Maine. Early morning clouds provided a beautiful sunrise and quickly left the sky providing one of those beautiful blue-bird days. Fresh man-made turns were plentiful on trails with recent snowmaking, and the groomers provided a fast, edgeable surface that is a ton of fun. We've been saying it all year, but our Mountain Ops team continues to impress.</p><p>Snowmaking will be back on as soon as temps drop tonight, continuing to resurface open terrain, and add more to our totals. Grooming will also be back on the hill tonight, continuing to work in what the snowmakers put down, and resurface open terrain. With another day of sunshine and warm temps on the way, you won't want to miss out.</p><p>&nbsp;See you up there!<br />-Team Snow</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
