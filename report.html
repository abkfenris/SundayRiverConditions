<h4><strong>February 2, 2023 | 1:50 PM</strong></h4><h4><strong style="font-size: 2em;">Afternoon Update</strong></h4><p>Good afternoon everyone, and happy Thursday! Let's cut right to the chase, as we have updates for you regarding our plans for this weekend. The bitter cold that everyone has been talking about will settle into the area this evening. On the mountain, there is a real chance that we will not see temperatures above 0 until Sunday, and that's without including wind chill. We're a hardy group up here, but cold is cold, and safety always comes first. With this in mind, we are making the following adjustments to our operations for tomorrow and Saturday.</p><p>First and foremost, we are going to be operating with a limited lift schedule. This allows us to have as many operators in place on a smaller number of lifts and will allow our Team to rotate out of the cold frequently. This means we can continue to provide lift-serviced skiing and riding in a manner that is safe for you, our guests, as well as our lift operators. This will close the Aurora Peak Quad and White Heat Quad until further notice.&nbsp; In addition, all regularly scheduled weekend and holiday lifts will not open on Saturday. This plan is a best-case scenario and does not take into account the winds, which are expected to be considerable. All changes in lift status will be updated below.</p><p>There are also several other changes to be aware of for tomorrow and Saturday. <strong>Uphill</strong><strong>&nbsp;Access </strong>will be closed until further notice. Please visit the <a href="/mountain-report#uphill_status">Uphill Status</a> section below for updates on when Uphill Access will re-open.&nbsp; In addition, <strong>Night Skiing</strong> has been canceled for this weekend, as well as <strong>Apres Aglow</strong>.</p><p>As of now, temperatures look like they'll break Saturday night, and we're planning to be back to normal operations by Sunday. This plan is subject to change depending on the weather that arrives, so be sure to keep your eyes here for all of the most up-to-date information.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Stay warm, and ski smart.</p><p>-Team Snow</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
