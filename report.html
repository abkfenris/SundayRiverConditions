<p><strong>November 17, 2022 | 6:05AM</strong></p><p>The 2022-23 New England ski season starts now. Do we need to say anything else? The Locke Triple will begin spinning at 9:00 AM for New England Pass, Ikon Pass, and Ticket Pack holders. Daily lift ticket access will begin Saturday, November 19 at 8:00 AM. Downloading will be required, but hey, you don't have to walk. Last chair will be thrown at 3:15PM, so be sure to get here early enough to get your first turns of the season in.</p><p>Some general notes to keep in mind before heading out for your first turns of the season. Pre-season conditions will exist. Please ski in control, and be aware of changing terrain. Snowmaking operations will be ongoing throughout the day on T2 and Sunday Punch. A buff or something of the sort is perfect for wiping off the goggles! At this time, there is <strong>no beginner terrain</strong> available on the mountain. In addition to this, due to limited terrain availability, <strong>no uphill traffic is permitted at this</strong>&nbsp;<strong>time.&nbsp;</strong>Our team is working exceptionally hard to take advantage of the prolonged cold and open additional terrain as fast as possible.&nbsp;</p><p>If the FOMO is already setting in, it's not too late to secure your <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/season-passes" title="Season Passes | Sunday River">New England Pass</a> or <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/ticket-packs">Maine Ticket Pack</a>. For those of you looking to take advantage of <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/cyber-monday" title="Cyber Monday | Sunday River">Cyber Monday</a> savings, the wait is over.
