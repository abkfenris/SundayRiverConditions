<h4><strong>March 6, 2023 | 1:48 PM</strong><strong></strong></h4><h4><strong style="font-size: 2em;">Afternoon Report</strong></h4><p>Well, we gave it the ol' college try but the winds were pretty darn ferocious and got the better of us. At the time of this report, we still have Little White Cap spinning, as well as the three carpets in South Ridge. We will continue to update the Mountain Report throughout the afternoon if anything changes. The upside is that today is forecasted to be the windiest day, so we're hopeful that we'll return to normal operation tomorrow.&nbsp;</p><p>That's about it for now. We'll see you back here bright and early tomorrow morning!</p><p>- Team Snow</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
