</p><p style="color: #696969; font-weight: 900; font-size: 12px;">TUESDAY, MARCH 2</p><div><p><strong>8AM Update: at this time, all lifts are on hold due to wind and our team is working to get our surface lifts open. Due to the limited terrain, uphill access is not permitted. If you have a lift ticket for today and don't plan on using it, please visit Guest Services at South Ridge.</strong></p><p>Mother Nature has rolled through with low temps and some blustery wind. We are expecting the high winds to affect many, if not all of our lifts today, which will limit access to open terrain. Our team will remain on standby, watching the forecast and checking lifts for opportunities to open. Groomers spent the night focusing on lower elevation terrain to make for the best possible conditions if we can get out there. The Chondola cabins will remain off to increase the likelihood of it spinning with the wind. Before hitting the slopes, take a look at the lift and trail status for updates.</p><p><span>Looking ahead, we will be enjoying lots of sunshine on the slopes later in the week and this weekend, and our mountain operations team is the best in the business at handling whatever Mother Nature throws our way. March always brings us the best sunshine and some snowy surprises. It&rsquo;s never too early to start planning your next <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/resort-lodging">weekend getaway</a>.</span></p><p><span>If you get hungry while on the slopes today we have plenty of food options to enjoy. Order online, head to the South Ridge takeout window or make a reservation at one of our <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/river-guide">resort dining locations</a>.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;Take advantage of the day and enjoy your meals outside on the decks and picnic areas.&nbsp;</span></span></p><p><span>We&nbsp;</span><a title="Online Store" href="https://shop.sundayriver.com/s/lift-tickets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>require online lift ticket purchase</strong></a><span>&nbsp;and set&nbsp;</span><strong>limits on the number of tickets</strong><span>&nbsp;sold for each day. This includes full-day, beginner, Threedom additional days, and Passholder Friend tickets. We only expect these limits to affect peak dates, but encourage everyone to buy early to ensure access on the dates you want. Season passes, Ikon passes, and lift ticket packs remain direct-to-lift with no restrictions or reservations.</span></p><p><span>Fast and contactless lift ticket pickup is available at our PUBs (Pick Up Boxes) at base lodges and hotels. Just scan the barcode at the bottom of your confirmation email and your RFID cards will print with your lift tickets or ticket packs loaded. For best results turn off dark mode on your phone if you use it and avoid email apps that use dark backgrounds.</span></p><p><span>Please remember to take a self-administered </span><a title="Health Screening" href="https://www.sundayriver.com/covid">Health Screening</a><span> and visit our&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/covid">COVID Winter Guide</a><span>&nbsp;before each trip to stay up-to-date on safety protocols and state guidelines.</span></p><p><span>Masks up!</span></p><p><span>Team Snow</span></p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
