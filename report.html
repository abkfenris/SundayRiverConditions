</h6><p style="color: #696969; font-weight: 900; font-size: 12px;">SUNDAY, JANUARY 24</p><p><strong>6:30AM Update:&nbsp;Please note we are experiencing high wind that will affect many of our lifts today. Once we have more information on wind holds, live updates will show in the lift status below.</strong></p><div><p>Unfortunately, the Sunday scaries are very real today. Mother Nature is feeling feisty this morning giving us high wind and blustery temps on the mountain. If you are planning to go to the slopes don&rsquo;t forget to bundle up and pack your hand warmers. If you don&rsquo;t feel like hitting the slopes today, we don&rsquo;t blame you. This is a classic winter day in New England with the rugged weather that first started sending folks to Florida.</p><p>As we look ahead, there are milder temps and sunny days on the schedule. The snow has been skiing fantastic and the snowmakers still have the flakes flying.&nbsp;</p></div><div>This winter, your car is your base lodge. We're here to help you make the most of it by<a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/gear-up-giveaway"> giving away over $1,000 in gear from YETI </a>to help you boot up in the morning, grab a quick lunch between laps, and kick back for apr&egrave;s.</div><div></div><p>There are plenty of food options around the resort for spreading out, but please remember that capacity is limited. Take a look at the <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/river-guide">River Guide</a> to discover locations, hours, online ordering, and how to make a reservation. For any needs such as season pass pickup, shopping, tuning, rentals, and SnowSports School, head to South Ridge Lodge.</p><p>We are&nbsp;<a title="Online Store" href="https://shop.sundayriver.com/s/lift-tickets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>requiring online lift ticket purchase</strong></a>&nbsp;and setting <strong>limits on the number of tickets</strong>&nbsp;sold for each day. This includes full-day, half-day, beginner, Threedom additional days, and Passholder Friend tickets. We only expect these limits to affect peak dates, but encourage everyone to buy early to ensure access on the dates you want. Season passes, Ikon passes, and lift ticket packs remain direct-to-lift with no restrictions or reservations.</p><p>Fast and contactless lift ticket pickup is available at our PUBs (Pick Up Boxes) at base lodges and hotels. Just scan the barcode at the bottom of your confirmation email and your RFID cards will print with your lift tickets or ticket packs loaded. For best results turn off dark mode on your phone if you use it and avoid email apps that use dark backgrounds.</p><p>Please remember to take a self-administered <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/covid" title="Health Screening">Health Screening</a> and visit our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/covid">COVID Winter Guide</a>&nbsp;before each trip to stay up-to-date on safety protocols and state guidelines.&nbsp;</p><p>Stay warm,</p><p>- Team Snow</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
