<h4><strong>April 15, 2023 | 2:00PM</strong><strong></strong></h4><h4><strong style="font-size: 2em;">Afternoon Report</strong></h4><p>What a morning! Bumps were slashed this morning at <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/donny-day" target="_blank" title="Donny Pelletiers Mogul Showdown" rel="noopener">Donny Pelletier's Mogul Showdown </a>and the skiing has been nothing but soft, springy, and spectacular. If you missed the man, the myth, the legend, Donny Pelletier this morning, you can still catch him roaming around the <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/the-great-tailgate" target="_blank" title="Great Tailgate " rel="noopener">Great Tailgate&nbsp;</a>this afternoon. Join us again tomorrow for <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/barker-express-final-send-off" target="_blank" title="Barker Express Final Send-Off" rel="noopener">Barker Express' final hurrah</a>, and watch as the final last chair heads up the mountain at 4pm.</p><p>While we are incredibly excited for all of the sunshine and celebrations this weekend, we do regrettably have to announce some changes to our <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/spring">Spring Operations schedule</a>.</p><p>The lift operations team, as well as representatives from Doppelmayr, have been battling a mechanical issue with the Jordan 8. Unfortunately, we will not be able to open the lift this weekend and have made the difficult decision to close Jordan until further notice while we continue to work on the problem.</p><p>Due to this change, we are adjusting our other lift operations to provide the most skiing we can. The Chondola will spin this weekend, with ski-in/ski-out from South Ridge access via Lower Lazy River. The Barker Express, Spruce Peak Triple, and White Cap quad will spin again tomorrow at 8AM.</p><p>We were incredibly excited for the next two weekends of spring skiing in the Jordan Bowl, and this is definitely not how we wanted to end our season. We apologize for the inconvenience this causes and will continue to aim to make the best weekend possible with our available lifts. Our teams will continue to do everything they can to get the Jordan 8 running for our planned closing weekend. Any updates will be announced here, so keep an eye out for any further changes in our plan.</p><p>Have fun and ski safe!&nbsp;</p><p>-Team Snow</p><p></p><p><strong>Mountain Notes;&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Please note that no beginner terrain is available at this time and trail conditions may vary and change rapidly throughout the day.&nbsp;</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
