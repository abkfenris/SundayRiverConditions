Head to the top of one of Sunday River's peaks for a cool breeze and phenomenal views of Western Maine, the White Mountains, and the Mahoosuc Mountains.<strong>&nbsp;Don't forget to bring plenty of water, sunscreen, a hat, suitable footwear,</strong> and some salty snacks to replace what you sweat out. Water bottle filling stations are located in South Ridge Lodge, as well as the hotels!&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Trails E and A are open from North Peak,</strong> but with a little detour; head to Second Mile and take a left up Three Mile to connect. If you&rsquo;re not sure of your route, please check with the Chondola operators to make sure you have a safe plan. Due to construction, be on the lookout for additional trail closure signage this week including&nbsp; North Peak and the bottom of the Spruce Triple.&nbsp;</p><p>Lowbush blueberries have come into season, especially on the upper mountain!&nbsp; If you choose to pick berries, a good practice is to take less than 1/10th of what is growing. Be cautious where you take your steps, protecting the blueberries and flowers are important for wildlife and other adventurers. Plentiful berries increase bear activity, so please keep an eye out and keep your distance. A good rule of thumb for wildlife encounters is truly a rule of thumb! With your arm outstretched, an animal should appear no bigger than the nail on your thumb. If it looks any larger, you are too close!</p><p>As you head to South Ridge base area, you may notice we have begun <strong>construction on Barker Mountain Rd.</strong> During the week, Monday - Friday, there will be limited access depending where the crew is working. Most access will be allowed via Cascade Hotel Hill Dr. Weekend traffic will flow as normal.&nbsp;</p><p>If you&rsquo;re hungry post-hike, the tacos at Sunny&rsquo;s Beer Garden, located at the base of the Chondola, are a must-try. Weather is looking wet for Friday and mid-week, so trails will be slippery at times. If you&rsquo;re traveling with little ones, check out trail H, the Kids&rsquo; Adventure Trail &ndash; there are some educational signs along the way down that make the descent a fun learning experience!</p><p>If you are injured or need assistance at any point, please contact&nbsp;<strong>Patrol at (207)-824-5350</strong>&nbsp;or visit our First Aid Clinic in the bottom of the South Ridge Lodge next to Betty's Treats and Treasures.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
