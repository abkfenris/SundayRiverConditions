Morning Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: April 1, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 7:19 AM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p><span>Happy April Fools' Day to all that celebrate, and happy March 32</span><sup>nd</sup><span> to all that don't. We've got a stunnah of a day coming at you. When you think of 'spring skiing', today's the day that comes to mind: bright sun, a beautiful blue sky, and snow that'll soften up by the mid-morning. The winds that plagued us through the weekend have dissipated and we're left with a nice breeze today. Temps are currently in the high 20s around the base and will get up to the 40s by midday. Moral of the story: bring your sunscreen.</span></p><p><span>Please note that White Heat will remain closed today for events staff to continue their work tearing down the Bust 'N' Burn venue.
