<strong>November 28, 2021</strong></p><p style="text-align: left;">Alert: Lazy River and Tourist Trap are open! More trails to slash up some snow? Yes please. The snow has been skiing beautifully, and the sun is keeping us warm and happy on this chillier afternoon. Need to beat the Sunday Scaries? We get it. Come ski with us.</p><p style="text-align: left;">Our snowmaking team has been working hard all day and will continue working tonight to lay down the base for future riding. Temps look good this week for terrain expansion so keep your eyes on the report daily! If you weren't able to join us today, have no fear: Locke Mountain Triple and the Barker Express both open at 9AM tomorrow. A few laps before a Monday morning meeting? Don't mind if I do.

We will offer beginner terrain as soon as coverage allows.</p><p style="text-align: left;">All lift tickets need to be <a href="https://shop.sundayriver.com/" title="online store">purchased online in advance</a>. <span style="font-weight: 400;"> Have your RFID from last year?
