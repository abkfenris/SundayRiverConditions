<p><strong>February 9, 2022</strong></p><p>There&rsquo;s no two ways about it, today is shaping up to be an absolutely exquisite day on the slopes. Our last storm system finally moved out yesterday afternoon, bringing in spring temps and sunshine for today. The grooming team worked their magic across all eight peaks last night, working yesterday&rsquo;s snow into that magnificent cord that we&rsquo;re so thankful for. All in all, we have 135 trails ranging from mellow cruisers to steep and soft bumps open for your selection. It doesn&rsquo;t get much better than this folks, so point your tips towards Newry. We&rsquo;ll see you when you get here.</p><p><strong>Around the Resort</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/presidents-week.xml">Presidents' Week</a> is less than two weeks away!
