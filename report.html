<h4><strong>January 14, 2023 | 6:35 AM</strong></h4><h2><strong>Morning Update</strong><span></span></h2><p>Saturday is here, and<a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/mlk-weekend"> MLK Weekend</a> has begun. As clouds move across the mountaintops this morning, snow dusts the surface of our freshly groomed trails. This scattered snow shower will continue until mid-day, adding a finishing touch to the weather we have received in the last 48 hours. Temps will remain in the high 20s all day, and winds should remain reasonably calm.</p><p>Our mountain ops team worked hard overnight, prepping the mountain for a great weekend ahead. They were able to push out, smooth, and groom areas of White Cap, opening the Little White Cap quad and provide beginner access to the Grand Summit Hotel via Green Cheese, Moonstruck, and starlight. The rest of the team were quick to it last night, drawing stripes back onto the rest of our eight peaks. There will be some active snowmaking today as long as temps remain cool.</p><p>Keep an eye on the mountain report today as Ski Patrol gets out there to inspect the trail conditions with plans to open more terrain as the day goes on. With over 400 acres of skiing, there are plenty of turns out there for everyone. <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/booklodging?Checkin=2023-1-12&amp;Checkout=&amp;Adults=2&amp;Children=0&amp;Others=0#/room" target="_blank" title="One night stays" rel="noopener">One-night stays</a> are now available for MLK Weekend at the Grand Summit and Snow Cap Inn.&nbsp; Availability is limited.
