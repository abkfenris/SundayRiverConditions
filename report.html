Morning Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: February 15, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 7:35 AM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>It's another chilly one this morning, so bundle up. It's currently 3 degrees at Jordan and 14 in Barker Basin. By midday, it should be in the high teens up top and mid-twenties in the base areas. We've got clear skies, a sunny morning, fast corduroy, and the wind system from yesterday seems to be moving out. What more could we ask for?</p><p>We have a slightly different list of groomed terrain this morning due to active snowmaking on a few trails. Lower Sunday Punch, Lollapalooza, Road Runner, and Lazy River all have active snowmaking this morning, although they're scheduled to come offline around 9AM. They will remain ungroomed for today. Otherwise, the grooming team took care of our standard list of midweek trails, and they also groomed the new snow on Cascades and Rogue Angel. Our snowmaking team is working diligently to resurface terrain across all 8 peaks.</p><p><a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/presidents-week" title="Presidents' Week | Sunday River, Maine">Presidents' Week </a>starts in a couple of days, and we have events planned for the whole family.
