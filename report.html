</p><p style="color: #696969; font-weight: 900; font-size: 12px;">SUNDAY, MARCH 7</p><div><p>Rise and shine! Today is another beautiful day on the slopes with sunshine, blue sky, eight peaks, and endless stripes. Last night the groomers spent the night prowling around the mountain and pressing out perfect corduroy. After a few hard days of work on Spruce and Barker, snowmakers are taking a very well-deserved break. Make sure you check out trails like American Express, Risky Business, Ecstasy, Right Stuff, and Sunday Punch, where snowmakers had spent their time resurfacing these last few days. If you&rsquo;re heading to the mountain as a beginner today, South Ridge has the best learning terrain. Start the day on the Sundance Surface Lifts and work your way up to South Ridge Express. &nbsp;</p><p style="font-style: inherit;">Lifts start spinning at 8AM today. Please note that the Chondola cabins are still off due to the wind this past week. Due to terrain conditions, the Oz Quad will not be open today.&nbsp;</p><p>If you get hungry while on the slopes we have multiple indoor and outdoor&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/river-guide" style="font-style: inherit;"><strong>dining options</strong></a><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">&nbsp;available this winter, including the ability to order online for select venues</span><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">.</span><span><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p><span>The <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/season-passes" title="Season Passes">2021-22 New England Pass is back on sale</a>, granting access to Sunday River, Loon &amp; Sugarloaf all next year.
