</p><p style="color: #696969; font-weight: 900; font-size: 12px;">SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 21</p><div><p>This morning you can expect beautiful packed powder corduroy from peak to peak. Last night the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrE6O76tiVQ">groomers did what they do best</a>, and reset the mountain for another perfect day of skiing and riding. The clouds have rolled in today with snow flurries on the way, and it looks like we could get a few inches out of it. Conditions have been phenomenal, and we are excited to see what else miss February will bring. Today we return back to our normal mid-week schedule with&nbsp;<strong style="font-style: inherit;">lifts opening at 9AM</strong>.</p><p><span>We&nbsp;</span><a title="Online Store" href="https://shop.sundayriver.com/s/lift-tickets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>require online lift ticket purchase</strong></a><span>&nbsp;and set&nbsp;</span><strong>limits on the number of tickets</strong><span>&nbsp;sold for each day. This includes full-day, beginner, Threedom additional days, and Passholder Friend tickets. We only expect these limits to affect peak dates, but encourage everyone to buy early to ensure access on the dates you want. Season passes, Ikon passes, and lift ticket packs remain direct-to-lift with no restrictions or reservations.</span></p><p><span>Fast and contactless lift ticket pickup is available at our PUBs (Pick Up Boxes) at base lodges and hotels. Just scan the barcode at the bottom of your confirmation email and your RFID cards will print with your lift tickets or ticket packs loaded. For best results turn off dark mode on your phone if you use it and avoid email apps that use dark backgrounds.</span></p><p><span>Please remember to take a self-administered </span><a title="Health Screening" href="https://www.sundayriver.com/covid">Health Screening</a><span> and visit our&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/covid">COVID Winter Guide</a><span>&nbsp;before each trip to stay up-to-date on safety protocols and state guidelines.</span></p><p><span>Carve it up!</span></p><p><span>Team Snow</span></p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
