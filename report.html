Afternoon Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: February 1, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 1:42 PM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>Temps in the high twenties, no wind, powdery corduroy; what more could we ask for? Today was a great day to hit the slopes, and there's more of that in store for tomorrow.&nbsp;</p><p>Our snowmaking team will be taking care of routine maintenance tonight as the temps creep outside our snowmaking window, but the guns should fire back up tomorrow night when the temps drop again. Grooming will be laying stripes on the usual list of trails, and they'll be working the new snow into Broadway, as well. Bear Paw will join their list tonight for the first time all season. We're expecting to open Upper T72 tomorrow morning with some additional features, so stay tuned for that.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/pride-weekend" title="Pride Weekend | Sunday River, Maine">Pride Weekend</a> starts this weekend, and there will be events for everyone to enjoy.
