Afternoon Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: December 3, 2023 </strong></em><strong>| 1:15 PM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>Powder alert!</p><p>The warmer temps of this morning certainly didn&rsquo;t last very long. We had some softer turns out there today, but the slopes will firm right up this evening and throughout the night. And, the news everyone wants to hear: we&rsquo;re in for a snow storm. Current predictions land us in the 8&rdquo;-10&rdquo; range, so think snow tonight.</p><p>The grooming team will make their way through the trails in batches throughout the night, so tomorrow we&rsquo;ll be able to expect a delightful mix of fresh corduroy and powder. Due to the dropping temperatures, the snow making team will hit the mountain hard over the course of tonight and the next few days.
