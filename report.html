Afternoon Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: March 14, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 1:45 PM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>Blue skies and sunshine are making an appearance from behind the clouds, and temps are certainly warmer than this morning. We've been loving the sunshine, but don't get used to it; it seems like we might get a couple of inches of snow tomorrow morning, so cross your fingers and think cold.&nbsp;</p><p>Our grooming team will take care of the same 72 trails as last night. The steeper, more advanced terrain will get an earlier groom, so be prepared for some firmer turns tomorrow on trails like White Heat and Vortex. As temps warm up throughout the day tomorrow, things will soften up, but the morning will start out fast. A few more naturals opened up today, like Celestial and Gnarnia, so head over that way this afternoon for some fun in the trees. make sure to check out the lift and terrain status below for the most up-to-date information.&nbsp;</p><p>Looking at season passes for next season?
