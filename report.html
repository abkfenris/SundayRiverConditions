<h4><strong>December 22, 2022 | 2:10 PM&nbsp;</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></h4><h2><strong>Afternoon Update</strong></h2><p>The clouds stuck around today, but the visibility was still good. The snow was a little grainy, but edges sank in allowing for great carves. Ski patrol dropped the ropes and opened up a few more trails today, bringing our open terrain to 383 acres.</p><p>Going into the night, our team will groom open terrain all over the resort and blow snow on the western side to improve open trails on Aurora and prepare for the grand opening of the Jordan 8. Snow showers will begin late into the night. By morning, temperatures will start rising, and the overnight snowfall may become unwanted precipitation. Let's hope the high winds can push this storm away before morning, and we will only receive a portion of the predicted weather.</p><p>We pride ourselves on our snowmaking power and grooming teams. They will do what they can to make trails as satisfactory as possible during this inclement weather. The forecast is coming from all directions, making it unclear what will happen in the next 24 hours; keep an eye on our daily mountain report for updates on lift and trail statuses throughout the day.</p><p>&nbsp;Happy Holidays!<br />-Team Snow</p><p>&nbsp;</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
