<p><strong>December 9, 2022 | 7:50AM</strong></p><p>Good morning Sunday River riders; we have new terrain open today at White Cap due to the tireless efforts of our mountain ops team. They took to the mountain overnight to groom out Jibe, Heats On, and lower Starlight, allowing for ski-in and ski-out access from the Grand Summit hotel using intermediate terrain only. The White Cap Quad will be running today to access these trails and connect you to Barker via Cascades.</p><p>The rest of the terrain we have available got a visit from the groomers last night, and parts of South Ridge will have active snowmaking this morning until temps begin to rise.</p><p>The other five available lifts remain open, and the Surface Lifts will get their first day in the books today as we kick off our <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/lessons">Snowsports School</a> season.</p><p>It will be a beautiful sunny day today, with temperatures ranging from mid-20s to mid-30s. Upper trails will be firm and fast this morning until the sun comes out and softens up that top surface. Please be cautious when skiing or riding new trails, as terrain conditions will vary.</p><p>If you plan on making your way up for the weekend, do not forget to pack your Santa suit and register for this year's <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/santa-sunday">Santa Sunday.</a></p><p>See you up there!</p><p>-Team Snow</p><p></p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
