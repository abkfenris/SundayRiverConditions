</h6><p style="color: #696969; font-weight: 900; font-size: 12px;">TUESDAY, JANUARY 19</p><p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="color: #333333;">After a long weekend with a storm that brought us 6-9&rdquo; of fresh snow, the mountain is in great shape. Over the past few days, ski patrol has been dropping ropes left and right with naturals opening up, giving us over 500 open acres to enjoy. Wizard's Gulch made its debut yesterday and Agony was added to the list today. Snowmaking will take a quick break today, but will be back online this evening with Shockwave and Rocking Chair. Groomers will head out tonight to press stripes across 8 peaks for tomorrow&rsquo;s turns, so head out for first chair at 9AM tomorrow for some awesome carving. </span><o:p></o:p></p><p>Already dreaming of the next weekend getaway? One-night stays are now available this weekend for the Jordan Hotel and the Snow Cap Inn. Please note that we are experiencing high call volume in our call center and recommend using our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/booklodging" style="font-style: inherit;"><strong>online booking engine</strong></a>&nbsp;for quotes or reservations.&nbsp;</p><p>There are plenty of food options around the resort for spreading out, but please remember that capacity is limited. Take a look at the <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/river-guide">River Guide</a> to discover locations, hours, online ordering, and how to make a reservation. For any needs such as season pass pickup, shopping, tuning, rentals, and SnowSports School, head to South Ridge Lodge.</p><p>This winter we are&nbsp;<a title="Online Store" href="https://shop.sundayriver.com/s/lift-tickets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>requiring online lift ticket purchase</strong></a>&nbsp;and setting <strong>limits on the number of tickets</strong>&nbsp;sold for each day. This includes full-day, half-day, beginner, Threedom additional days, and Passholder Friend tickets. We only expect these limits to affect peak dates, but encourage everyone to buy early to ensure access on the dates you want. Season passes, Ikon passes, and lift ticket packs remain direct-to-lift with no restrictions or reservations.</p><p>Fast and contactless lift ticket pickup is available at our PUBs (Pick Up Boxes) at base lodges and hotels. Just scan the barcode at the bottom of your confirmation email and your RFID cards will print with your lift tickets or ticket packs loaded. For best results turn off dark mode on your phone if you use it and avoid email apps that use dark backgrounds.</p><p>Before each trip to the slopes, make sure you visit our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/covid">COVID Winter Guide</a>&nbsp;to make a plan for your visit and stay on top of any potential changes.&nbsp;</p><p>See you tomorrow!</p><p>- Team Snow</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
