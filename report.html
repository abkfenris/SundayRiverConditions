<h5>January 3, 2022</h5><p>It is a beautiful morning on the mountain! We have the most options in the East for you to select from, with over 70 open trails and 410 acres to enjoy. Snowmakers are blasting guns on American Express and Tempest today to cover even more terrain in newly made snow. The sun is shining on fresh corduroy, atop 65 trails to carve. Lifts will be spinning from 9AM-3:45PM, so grab first chair to start your week off on the right ski boot!</p><p>Both hotels are now ski-in/ski-out for your convenience. To ski into the Grand Summit Hotel via green terrain, take Little White Cap Quad and ski down Moonstruck via Green Cheese. To access the Jordan Hotel via green terrain, please ride the Jordan Bowl Express, and ski Lollapalooza. At this time, all other green trails into the Jordan Hotel are temporarily considered advanced terrain.<o:p></o:p></p><p><strong>Around the Resort</strong><o:p></o:p></p><p>Grab a bite at all our open restaurants and food trucks on the mountain, including <a href="/resort-dining/coffee-hound" title="coffee hound">Coffee Hound</a> in South Ridge Lodge Food Court, the Ona-Tripp Food Truck, and more.
