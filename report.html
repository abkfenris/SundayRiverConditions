<h4><strong>January 15, 2023 | 8:11 AM</strong></h4><h2><strong>Morning Update</strong><span></span></h2><p>Good Morning Sunday River rippers, and happy Sunday. Today's weather brings cool temps in the high 20s all day, partly cloudy skies, and calm winds. It looks like it will be a fantastic day to explore over 400 acres of open terrain on 17 lifts to choose from.</p><p>Snowmaking was at full blast last night, with over 200 snow guns covering the mountain. These guns will remain on for the morning but are mostly located on closed terrain. Our team is working nightly to make as much snow as possible on these closed trails to provide more skiing for everyone in the coming weeks.</p><p>Snowcats hit the slopes right after the final chair last night, giving them enough time to groom fresh trails across all eight peaks. Keep an eye on the Mountain Report to see if Ski Patrol gives the ok to open any new terrain. We are looking at another week of mild winter temps, partial clouds, and maybe even a little natural snowfall in the future.</p><p>&nbsp;All signs point to great days on the hill. We will see you out there!<br />-Team Snow</p><p><strong>UPDATE:</strong>&nbsp; Barker Mountain Lodge will be open with LIMITED services this morning.&nbsp; The lodge may be accessed for use of the main restrooms and locker rooms, but the kitchen, bar, and handicap restroom are not available at this time.&nbsp; Thank you for your patience as we work to restore full services.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
