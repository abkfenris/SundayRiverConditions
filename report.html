It's been nothing but blue skies and beautiful temps for the final weekend of the Barker Express, and we're so stoked to be sharing it with all of you.</p><p>Looking ahead, we are planning to spin the Chondola and the Spruce Peak Triple tomorrow. The mountain will be closed Tuesday-Friday while we re-group for one more hurrah. Please note, uphill access will be closed from Tuesday-Friday. We have a big summer of upgrades planned, which means lots of heavy machinery moving around the mountain.&nbsp;</p><p>There are still a few more hours left to get your final ride on the quad before we call last chair for good. Come get yours before it's too late.</p><p>We'll see you out there!</p><p>-Team Snow</p><p></p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
