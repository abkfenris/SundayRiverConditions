Morning Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: December 25, 2023 </strong></em><strong>| 6:35 AM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>From all of us here at Sunday River, Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays.&nbsp;</p><p>Today's lineup will be the same as yesterday's, with over 130 acres from Spruce Peak to White Cap. The snowmakers had a well-deserved night off last night as temps left the snowmaking zone, but that didn't hold the groomers back from getting out there and working their magic.</p><p>At this time, there is still no beginner terrain available. However, we are happy to share the South Ridge Express and the magic carpets will reopen on tomorrow, December 26. The plan is for the South Ridge Express to start spinning at 10AM with the magic carpets reopening at 8AM. Please note that beginner terrain will only be accessible out of South Ridge, where other parts of the resort will be considered advanced terrain.</p><p>With South Ridge reopening tomorrow, that means our SnowSports School will be back in action. <span>Offering both day lessons and season-long instructional programs, <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/lessons">check out which lesson</a> works for you.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>We have exciting events happening this week, from <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/fireworks">fireworks</a> to dinner with <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/winter-activities/eddy-and-betty-the-yetis">Eddy and Betty</a>.
