<p><strong>March 8, 2022</strong></p><p>As blue skies start to peek through this morning, winds roll the clouds out of town. Please keep an eye on the lift and trail status as we will have delayed openings this morning. Winds are forecasted to calm as we ski into the afternoon, and we expect to have even more open terrain by tomorrow as this variable weather leaves town. As we experience wind holds today, we understand if you want to start your runs a little after 9AM first chair.
