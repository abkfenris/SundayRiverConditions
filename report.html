Morning Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: January 9, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 7:45 AM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>Good morning folks, and welcome to another beautiful Tuesday. Yesterday was a real treat, with Sunday's fresh snow turning into incredible corduroy, courtesy of the grooming team. Today is shaping up to be more of the same.&nbsp;</p><p>We're starting off partly cloudy and cold this morning, so be sure to grab an extra layer before heading out to the lift. This cold has made for ideal snowmaking temps, which we've been taking advantage of. The whales are really piling up, and we're looking forward to expanding terrain as soon as possible.&nbsp;</p><p>Clouds will be moving in throughout the day as our next storm system enters the area. The forecast has been pretty dynamic with this storm, but the latest guidance has us in a band of 12-18" of snow before warm arm sneaks in on the backside of the system. We'll have to see how everything shakes out, but it's safe to say that we will be seriously building our base with this one.</p><p><a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/special-deals/dash-deals-sale" title="Dash Deals | Sunday River, Maine">Dash Deals</a> will only be available for two more days.
