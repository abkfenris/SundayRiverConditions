<h5>December 18, 2021</h5><ul></ul><p>The flurries are flying here at Sunday River! With the most open terrain in the East, 6-9" of fresh powder is about to span over almost 50 trails and 300 acres. Snowmakers are working with Mother Nature tonight, blasting guns to make even more terrain available. Newly opened today, Jordan Bowl has stripes on Kansas, Cyclone, State Fair, and Lollapalooza. <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/winterfest-weekend" title="Winterfest Weekend | Sunday River">Winterfest</a> is looking like a winter wonderland tonight with fireworks, twilight skiing, fire dancers, fresh snow and more. Twilight skiing is <a href="https://shop.sundayriver.com/s/lift-tickets/p/twilight-tickets" target="_blank" title="Twilight Tickets" rel="noopener">$10 for all ages</a>, sold exclusively online for your convenience. South Ridge Express and the Chondola will be spinning from 3:00PM-6:30PM tonight so you can carve the powdery twilight trails.</p><p>Since Jordan Bowl is open, both hotels are now ski-in/ski-out access for your convenience. Please note our only beginner terrain is available within the South Ridge Express Quad at this time. With this in mind, skiing into the Grand Summit Hotel is currently accessible via blue terrain. At this time, we are sold out of snowboards at our rental shop for the duration of this weekend. Come shred to your heart's content!</p><p><strong>Around the Resort</strong></p><p>Recently opened for the season, Sliders Restaurant is conveniently located at the Jordan Hotel, and the Mountain Room is in Peak Lodge.
