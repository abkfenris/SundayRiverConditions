<h4><strong>February 12, 2023 | 1:45 PM</strong></h4><h4><strong style="font-size: 2em;">Afternoon Report</strong></h4><p>Another weekend of skiing and riding here in Western Maine is coming to an end. The sun was shining bright, and plenty of guests were out enjoying the nice weather and exploring the mountain trails. Ski patrol was able to open up a few more runs as the day went on, and winds remained calm unable to affect our lift statuses. The mix of warm days and cold nights have begun to firm up our snowpack in some areas. Nothing that a solid groom from our snowcats can't fix.</p><p>This week's weather looks average, with partially cloudy skies and temperatures ranging throughout the 20s and 30s all week. No significant snowstorm is forecasted anytime soon, so let's hope temps can remain low overnight for plenty of snowmaking in the days ahead.</p><p>We hope you enjoy the rest of your weekend and are thinking about making your way over to Sunday River for a fun day of skiing and riding soon.</p><p>See you next time!</p><p>-Team Snow</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
