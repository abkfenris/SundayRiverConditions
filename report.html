<h4><strong>January 16, 2023 | 2:58 PM</strong></h4><h2><strong>Afternoon Report</strong><span></span></h2><p>Today was a classic New England day with weather changing on a dime. We started the day with some nice fluffy flakes across the resort, which slowly changed over to sleet, and then a touch of that not-so-frozen precipitation. Thankfully the rain was very brief and localized to the lower elevations, so that won't cause any issues with tonight's grooming and snowmaking.&nbsp;</p><p>While we are wrapping up the long weekend, we do have more events coming up. Next Monday marks the start of <a href="/events/senior-week" title="Senior Week">Senior Week</a> running from January 23 through January 27. And as always, keep your eyes on the Mountain Report for all your resort-wide updates.</p><p>&nbsp;See you up there!<br />-Team Snow</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
