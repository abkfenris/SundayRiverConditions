Morning Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: March 27, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 7:35 AM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>We have 882 acres of open terrain for you today, with 139 trails and 12 lifts. We have some warmer temperatures in store today, and it's currently in the low to mid-thirties across the mountain. Temps should rise to the low forties by this afternoon. Due to the light precipitation and temps just below freezing last night, some of the terrain has a light glaze on the surface. That will disappear this morning as temperatures warm up, so take your time with your morning coffee before you head to the mountain.&nbsp;</p><p>Our grooming team took care of 79 trails last night, including almost all of our beginner terrain. Most of our intermediate terrain and some advanced terrain were also groomed last night, including trails like Three Mile Trail, Excalibur, and Obsession. Whether you want a groomer or time in the trees, you'll find it here.
