<p><strong>December 7, 2022 | 7:50 AM</strong></p><p>If you plan on making your way up, don't forget to pack your Gortex, or maybe even a couple of trash bags and a goggle wipe. These warm temperatures can be wet but make for excellent conditions under your feet. Our team has been working hard to create a solid base of snow that has not been majorly affected by last night's weather. The groomers gave South Ridge a once-over this morning on all green terrain. The rest of the mountain was left alone last night to preserve the snowpack. Please be cautious of mixed terrain and conditions today as you search for the best trail. If you plan on coming up this weekend don't forget to register for<a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/santa-sunday" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Santa Sunday</a> before its too late.</p><p>Hopefully, we can get out of this weather rut soon, and a real winter will be on the way. Once temps allow, we will continue to expand our skiable terrain towards White Cap basin and Jordan. If you can get out there and turn a gray day into a great day, then why wouldn't you?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;We'll see you out there!</p><p>-Team Snow</p><p></p><p></p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
