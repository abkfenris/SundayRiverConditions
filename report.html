<h4><strong>March 9, 2023 | 7:30 AM</strong><strong></strong></h4><h4><strong style="font-size: 2em;">Morning Report</strong></h4><p>Happy Thursday, my fellow snow lovers. Today will be another fantastic day to boot up and get out there. Our mountain ops team spent the night grooming out all the usual trails, and it is becoming a beautiful day here in western Maine.</p><p>Like the last few days, the sun is shining bright, but some clouds and warm temps are in the forecast again today. These comfortable temps will surely keep the snow nice and soft. Perfect for really digging your edge into. All standard weekday lifts are scheduled, and our trails remain open, all thanks to the terrific snowpack.</p><p>The week is starting to come to an end, and a beautiful weekend is in sight. With more mild temps ahead, it looks like a great weekend to pack the bags and hit the road to Sunday River. <span data-preserver-spaces="true"><a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/season-passes" title="Season Passes">2023-24 New England Passes are </a><strong><a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/season-passes" title="Season Passes">now on sale</a>. </strong>Take advantage of the chance to lock in your pass at the year's lowest prices during our one-week flash sale.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">We'll see you out there!<br /></span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">-Team Snow</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
