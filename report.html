<h5>February 1, 2022</h5><p>Start the first of the month catching first chair! Lifts are spinning at 9AM for you to carve into 81 trails with fresh corduroy. After 12-14" of new snow, we have beautiful powdery snow stashes across all 8 peaks for you to shred today. Yesterday we enjoyed Celestial, Chutzpah, Shock Wave, Black Hole, Super Nova, and more! We have another full day of blue skies and sunshine on the slopes, so come ski until 3:45PM. Choose from nearly 800 acres of open terrain to take your Tuesday turns!</p><p>Please note that ski-in access to the Jordan Hotel requires the navigation of intermediate trails to reach Jordan Bowl.</p><p><strong>Around the Resort</strong><o:p></o:p><a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/wicked-air-and-apres"></a></p><p>For the latest updates on available shopping, dining, and activities whenever you visit us, head to the <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/river-guide" target="_blank" title="river guide" rel="noopener">River Guide</a>.<o:p></o:p></p><p>-Team Snow</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
