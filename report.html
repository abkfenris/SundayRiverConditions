Morning Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: January 12, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 7:47 AM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>Temperatures today will be in the high twenties to low thirties before dropping down into the teens tonight. We'll start the day with partly cloudy skies, but it sounds like the sun will be out by mid-morning. We have over 350 acres of open terrain today, twilight skiing tonight, and snow expected tomorrow. Sounds like a great way to dive into the weekend.&nbsp;</p><p>Our snowmaking team ran our system to full capacity last night, and they'll continue making snow throughout the day. Our grooming team pushed out a few new trails for us, and Dream Maker now joins our open terrain. Tempest was groomed top to bottom, and Ridge Run will be closed today for aggressive snowmaking. Who Ville will open this afternoon, and we're expecting around 16 features in the park.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>This weekend is <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/mlk-weekend" title="MLK Weekend | Sunday River, Maine">Martin Luther King Jr. Weekend</a>, and we have fun for the whole family.
