Please scroll down to "Lift Status" for live updates.&nbsp;</p><p>Rise and shine! The sun is out and the snow is fast, so grab your carvers and slice up that morning corduroy. The groomers were out all night laying down stripes and those are the trails you will want to hit first. Give the sun some time to shine on the naturals to let them soften up this afternoon. Enjoy carving your way down trails like Escapade, Risky Business, Wildfire, and Jibe. Soak up the sunshine and work on those mask tans, the newest fashion trend on the slopes.&nbsp;</p><p>Lifts will start spinning at 9AM. The Chondola cabins will remain off due to the wind. Take advantage of our <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/sunday-river-app">Sunday River App</a>&nbsp;for a quick and easy way to check trail and lift updates on your phone.&nbsp;</p><p>Want to hit the slopes in March?
