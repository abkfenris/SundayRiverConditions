The sun has been shining all day, warming us up and providing that sweet Vitamin D. The groomers have been sweet, and we have a strong base throughout our glades for some fun tree skiing. If you haven't made it up to the mountain yet this week, this afternoon wouldn't be a bad time to start! A reminder that there may be some snow coming our way later this week, so keep on snow dancing. Twilight skiing is open until 6:30 tonight, so stick around for some skiing under the lights. Join us afterward at South Ridge for two Fire Dancer shows at <strong>6:15 and 6:45PM</strong>, followed by a spectacular fireworks display at <strong>7PM</strong>. In case you're going to bed early tonight, a reminder that lifts open at 8AM tomorrow, and first chair is the early bird's reward.&nbsp;</p><p>Twilight skiing will continue tonight through Saturday for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/presidents-week">Presidents&rsquo; Week</a> with access to the Chondola and South Ridge Express until 6:30PM.
