Morning Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: January 10, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 7:46 AM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>15" of fresh snow? Thank you, Mother Nature.&nbsp;</p><p>Last night and into this morning, we had about 15" of snow hit the slopes. It's wetter snow, so it's perfect for base-building, and those stripes lay well on top. This amount of snow will set us up really nicely for terrain expansion, as it's an amazing base for grooming and additional snowmaking. Between this, the snow forecasted for Friday, and the phenomenal efforts of our Mountain Ops crew, it's shaping up to be a fantastic weekend.&nbsp;</p><p>Here's the not-so-great part: the wind is supposed to pick up through the day, and wind holds and closures are likely. Make sure to check back here throughout the day for the most updated lift and terrain status. Temps are also warming up some, and our frozen precipitation has changed to unfrozen precipitation. Fortunately, due to the amount and quality of the snow we just received, the impact of this part of the storm should be minimal.&nbsp;</p><p>Today, we can expect the same grooming lineup as last night, plus some extra challenges with the snow. Our steeps were groomed before the majority of the snow, so head over to trails like Right Stuff, Downdraft, and Rogue Angel to experience the new snow. Tempest remains ungroomed, complete with snowmaking whalebacks, and South Ridge was groomed earlier this morning, after most of the snow.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/special-deals/dash-deals-sale" title="Dash Deals | Sunday River, Maine">Dash Deals</a> are already winding down.
