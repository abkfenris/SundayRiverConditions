There are no additional trail closures this week, but please remember to use caution when hiking near the top of the Chondola. All trails uphill of the Chondola are closed for the summer due to ongoing construction. Don&rsquo;t forget your bug spray and plenty of water &ndash; the temperature is going up this weekend! </span>Check out the full hiking map <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/documents/Sunday%20River/Maps/sunday-river-hiking-2022.pdf" title="hiking map 2022">here</a>.</p><p>This summer we&rsquo;ve added three new hiking trails:</p><ul><li>Tango (trail A). A moderate trail that winds through the Last Tango glade. Access it by hiking the South Ridge Loop uphill before taking a left on Thataway and entering by the bottom of the Spruce Triple.</li><li>Yetiville (Trail K). Meander through Yetiville on this moderate trail by hiking up the Kids Adventure Trail toward North Peak. When you reach Sensation, enjoy looking out over Western Maine with Dream Maker below you before taking a sharp right to head back into the woods. Stroll down the AP road back to South Ridge (but be mindful of passing vehicles and machinery!) or avoid the road and explore our new trail&hellip;</li><li>Palisades (Trail C) an easy rolling traverse from Ridge Run into Aurora Basin. <span>You can join up with Yetiville (Trail K), or continue all the way to the Aurora Basin. </span>Take a left at the bridge to head up Yetiville (Trail K), or if you&rsquo;re hankering for some sun and a breeze, walk up to North Peak on Sensation (but be mindful of passing vehicles and machinery!)</li></ul><p>If you&rsquo;re feeling ambitious, take a hike up to White Cap on Trail J. We&rsquo;ve rated this trail Extreme as it&rsquo;s not for the faint of heart, but it will test your strength and stamina and you&rsquo;ll be rewarded with the best view on the mountain accessible this summer!</p><p>We have many new and exciting projects underway at Sunday River, including of the <a href="/jordan-8" title="Jordan 8">Jordan 8</a>, which means we&rsquo;ve unfortunately had to close hiking access to Spruce, Aurora, Oz, and Jordan peaks. For your safety, please obey signage at all times and remain aware of your surroundings, especially when choosing to walk on roads.</p><p>Some trails may be closed periodically during the summer for construction projects. Please check the weekly Mountain Report for updates and obey all posted signage.</p><p>If you need assistance, get lost, or are injured, don&rsquo;t hesitate to call Patrol at (207)-824-5350. Patrol will be available 7 days a week during normal operating hours.</p><p></p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
