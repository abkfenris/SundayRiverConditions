<h4><strong>January 28, 2023 | 6:30 AM</strong></h4><h4><strong style="font-size: 2em;">Morning Report</strong></h4><p>Happy Saturday, Sunday River rippers. Today we expect mild winter temps and clean, smooth groomers expanding over 700 acres of terrain. It will be around 20 degrees here at the base of South Ridge by first chair this morning and begin warming up to the mid-30s by midday / early afternoon. Clouds will pass by most of the day, but hopefully, the sun will peak through to soften up the surface and improve visibility.</p><p>Our Mountain Ops team was hard at work last night using the snow we had received and made in the previous week to create the best skiing surface possible for the weekend ahead. They took to most trails, turning up the snow and resurfacing it with those beautiful Sunday River stripes. Please be cautious when entering ungroomed terrain as snow pack on the side of trails and in the woods may have firm crusts and be dificult to maneuver in. Over 100 snow guns were turned on last night, making a fresh layer of snow on closed trails in preparation for expansion. Some of these guns will be actively making snow as the day continues.</p><p>Looking to see our beautiful mountain range from a new perspective? We are excited to announce the opening of our Merrill Hill Triple today, providing access to more beginner terrain and incredible views just off of Ridge Run at South Ridge.</p><p>It is going to be another fantastic weekend here in the heart of western Maine, and we hope you can make it to the slopes to enjoy it with us.</p><p>&nbsp;See you out there!<br />-Team Snow</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
