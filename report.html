Morning Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: December 9, 2023 </strong></em><strong>| 6:41 AM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>Today's the day: the Barker 6 is finally here. With a new lift comes new trails, so head over to Barker to carve up some brand-new corduroy.&nbsp; The Spruce Triple is also scheduled to make its season debut later this morning, so don't forget to check out the mix of groomed and ungroomed terrain there. The majority of our open terrain is groomed, but if you're looking for an extra challenge, head over to Aludra, Borealis, Airglow, and American Express for some ungroomed terrain. Please be aware that there is also active snowmaking on Upper Risky Business and Cascades. With comfortable temps and light wind, we're in for a great day.&nbsp;</p><p>Join us in a historic celebration of our newest chair at 8:45AM this morning, with the first chair spinning at 9AM.&nbsp; In addition to exclusive swag, we also have one last in-person opportunity to win a seat on the very first chair. We're excited for this, and we hope you are too.
