LIFT TICKETS ARE SOLD OUT FOR SATURDAY, JANUARY 16 &amp; SUNDAY, JANUARY 17</h6><p style="color: #696969; font-weight: 900; font-size: 12px;">THURSDAY, JANUARY 14</p><p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="color: #333333;">Lifts will start spinning at 9AM tomorrow. Snow conditions have been incredible with amazing corduroy blanketing all eight peaks. Thanks to all the hard work from our snowmakers, ropes dropped on White Heat yesterday and today on Lost Princess. Plus, groomers put stripes on 3D last night and will be adding stripes on Wildfire tonight. Snowmaking will continue tonight on trails like Salvation, South Paw, Vortex, and Top Gun. To put the cherry on top, it looks like Mother Nature could drop 5-8" of new snow on Saturday,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>but keep snow dancing so we avoid any mixed precipitation.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></p><p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline;"><span color="#333333" style="color: #333333;">As we head into the long weekend <strong>we will be skiing and riding on all eight peaks</strong>. Join us for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/mlk-weekend">Martin Luther King Jr. Weekend</a>&nbsp;and enjoy twilight skiing Friday and Saturday, an Indie Demo Day on Saturday, and fireworks with a fire dancer Saturday night.</span></p><p>If you're looking for a last-minute getaway, we still have resort lodging available this weekend. As an added bonus, <strong>all lodging guests are guaranteed lift ticket access, even when we are sold out like we are this weekend.</strong> Please note that we are experiencing high call volume in our call center and guest services, so we recommend using our&nbsp;<a href="/booklodging" target="_blank" title="Book Lodging " rel="noopener">online booking engine</a> for lodging quotes and booking. Both of our resort hotels are ski-in/ski-out with access to beginner terrain and the Snow Cap in is a short walk or shuttle ride to the slopes.</p><p>There are plenty of food options around the resort for spreading out, but please remember that capacity is limited. Take a look at the <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/resort-dining">dining guide</a> for daily hours or to make a reservation. For any needs such as season pass pickup, shopping, tuning, rentals, and SnowSports School, head to South Ridge Lodge.</p><p>For the safety of our team members and guests, we are&nbsp;<a title="Online Store" href="https://shop.sundayriver.com/s/lift-tickets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>requiring online lift ticket purchases</strong></a>&nbsp;and setting <strong>limits on the number of tickets sold</strong> for each day. This includes day, half-day, beginner, Threedom additional days, and Passholder Friend tickets. We only expect these limits to come into play on peak dates, but encourage everyone to buy early to ensure access on the dates you want. Season passes, Ikon passes, and lift ticket packs remain direct-to-lift with no restrictions or reservations.</p><p>Fast and contactless lift ticket pickup is available at our PUBs (Pick Up Boxes) throughout the resort. Just scan the barcode at the bottom of your confirmation email and your RFID cards will print with your lift tickets or ticket packs loaded. For best results turn off dark mode on your phone if you use it and avoid email apps that use dark backgrounds.</p><p>Before heading to the slopes make sure you visit our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/covid">COVID Winter Guide</a>&nbsp;to make a plan for your visit and stay on top of any potential changes.&nbsp;</p><p>Carve on!</p><p>- Team Snow</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
