</p><p style="color: #696969; font-weight: 900; font-size: 12px;">MONDAY, MARCH 22</p><p>What a day. It&rsquo;s a gorgeous Monday on the mountain with endless blue sky and sunshine. Spring is here, which means soft snow, fun bumps, and reverse goggle tans, also known as mask tans. Tonight groomers will press out stripes on nearly 70 trails but leave some trails ungroomed like White Heat, Right Stuff, Tempest, Airglow, and Excalibur. With soft snow and sunshine all week, it is time to get those bump legs into gear. Tomorrow is going to be another beautiful day like today, so start thinking of excuses to leave work early. Lifts will start spinning at 9AM tomorrow.&nbsp;</p><div><p>With operations open daily through April 24, there is plenty of ski season ahead.
