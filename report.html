<h4><strong>December 30, 2022 | 1:15 PM</strong></h4><h2><strong>Afternoon Update</strong><span></span></h2><p>Jackets were off, decks were full, and everyone was out today enjoying the warm temperatures and soft snow. It was a great day of spring conditions on this late December day. Skiers and riders took full advantage of the 60 trails and 16 lifts available today, and the stoke was high.</p><p>The Mountain Ops crew will be back on the hill overnight, grooming out all open terrain they can get to, laying down those stripes for the morning. The weather tomorrow looks pretty similar to today, at least during our operating hours, with temps ranging from mid-thirties to mid-forties. Clouds will constantly pass by, letting the sun peak through every now and then throughout the day.</p><p>If you're sticking around this weekend to get some more runs in, check out everything else we have going on around the resort to wrap up the <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/christmas-vacation-weeks">holiday week</a> and celebrate the <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/new-years-eve">new year</a>.</p><p>&nbsp;We will see you out there!<br />-Team Snow</p><p><b>UPDATED Uphill Policy</b><span>: Uphill travel is NOT</span><span>&nbsp;permitted until further notice.&nbsp;</span></p><p></p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
