LIFT TICKETS ARE SOLD OUT FOR SATURDAY, JANUARY 16 &amp; SUNDAY, JANUARY 17</h6><p style="color: #696969; font-weight: 900; font-size: 12px;">SATURDAY, JANUARY 16</p><p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline;"><span color="#333333" style="color: #333333;">After a bit of mixing this morning, the past few hours have been full on snow and it's coming down hard. Mother Nature has gifted us with 5-8" so far and there's only more to come, with forecasts of up to an additional 4-6" by morning. Keep it up out there and enjoy some free refills until 6:30PM with twilight skiing, then make a night of it with fire dancer shows at 6:15PM and 6:45PM, and fireworks at 7PM. Groomers will head out tonight to smooth things out and our snowmaking team is taking a well-deserved break while Mother Nature takes over. Please note that we are anticipating gusty winds for tomorrow, so continue to check the report for updated lift status. In preperation, our team has removed the cabins off of the Chondola to give us a better chance of avoiding a wind hold.</span></p><p>If you're looking for a last-minute getaway, we still have resort lodging available this weekend. As an added bonus, <strong>all lodging guests are guaranteed lift ticket access, even when we are sold out like we are this weekend.</strong> Please note that we are experiencing high call volume in our call center and guest services, so we recommend using our&nbsp;<a href="/booklodging" target="_blank" title="Book Lodging " rel="noopener">online booking engine</a> for lodging reservations or quotes. Both of our resort hotels are ski-in/ski-out with access to beginner terrain and the Snow Cap in is a short walk or shuttle ride to the slopes.</p><p>There are plenty of food options around the resort for spreading out, but please remember that capacity is limited. Take a look at the <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/river-guide">River Guide</a> to discover locations, hours, online ordering, and how to make a reservation. For any needs such as season pass pickup, shopping, tuning, rentals, and SnowSports School, head to South Ridge Lodge.</p><p>For the safety of our team members and guests, we are&nbsp;<a title="Online Store" href="https://shop.sundayriver.com/s/lift-tickets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>requiring online lift ticket purchases</strong></a>&nbsp;and setting <strong>limits on the number of tickets sold</strong> for each day. This includes day, half-day, beginner, Threedom additional days, and Passholder Friend tickets. We only expect these limits to come into play on peak dates, but encourage everyone to buy early to ensure access on the dates you want. Season passes, Ikon passes, and lift ticket packs remain direct-to-lift with no restrictions or reservations.</p><p>Fast and contactless lift ticket pickup is available at our PUBs (Pick Up Boxes) throughout the resort. Just scan the barcode at the bottom of your confirmation email and your RFID cards will print with your lift tickets or ticket packs loaded. For best results turn off dark mode on your phone if you use it and avoid email apps that use dark backgrounds.</p><p>Before each trip to the slopes, make sure you visit our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/covid">COVID Winter Guide</a>&nbsp;to make a plan for your visit and stay on top of any potential changes.&nbsp;</p><p>Keep snow dancing!</p><p>- Team Snow</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
