<h4><strong>January 19, 2023 | 7:35 AM</strong></h4><h2><strong>Morning Report</strong><span></span></h2><p>Good morning Sunday River riders and shredders. All is quiet as the sun begins to rise over the horizon of the mountains. Snow guns create clouds across the trails, and the cats are put away after a long night's work. The mountain is ready for yet another great day for all to enjoy. We are looking at over 400 acres of skiable terrain and 13 lifts to access it all.</p><p>Today's weather will remain in the mid-30s, with clouds coming in from the west. It is a little gusty in some of the mountains this morning; keep an eye on the <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/mountain-report">lift statuses</a> until the winds begin to calm down mid-day. As temperatures drop later tonight, we should see some snowfall accumulating into Friday. This will set us up for some fantastic skiing and riding in the upcoming days. Let's hope the winds can push this storm in the perfect direction, providing us with another fresh blanket of snow for the weekend.</p><p>&nbsp;We will see you out there<br />-Team Snow</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
