<h4><strong>January 10, 2023 | 7:35 AM</strong></h4><h2><strong>Morning Report</strong><span></span></h2><p>Flakes are flying here at the mountain, and while it isn't exactly base-building snow, it's making for one beautiful snow globe this morning. Not to be outdone, our snowmakers are continuing their march towards expansion. Seeing White Heat under the gun is certainly a sight for sore eyes.</p><p>The grooming team also got to work last night and had an extremely productive night. Winch cat operations took place in Jordan, with Rogue and Excalibur getting full refreshes. Every flake that falls is another flake that our groomers can work into our phenomenal snow surface. All in all, it's shaping up to be a tremendous day of skiing and riding.&nbsp;</p><p>Looking ahead, there's a storm on the horizon, but indications are mixed as to what we are actually looking at. Check back this afternoon for an update on the weekend ahead.</p><p><strong>Please note:</strong> There is currently no beginner terrain into and out of the Grand Summit Hotel.</p><p>See you on the slopes!</p><p>-Team Snow</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
