Morning Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: March 19, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 7:35 AM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>This morning greeted us with a nice coating of white thanks to some light flurries moving through the area this evening. We've got another excellent day on nearly 700 acres of terrain for you to start the day.&nbsp;</p><p>Temps are expected to remain cool today, which will make for some awesome groomers to put your edges into. Lazy River will be closed today. Access to Spruce Peak from Barker will be via Three Mile, which is currently skiing more like a blue. Please plan accordingly for less experience skiers in your party. This also means that uphill access to Barker is closed today.</p><p>Temps are expected to drop tonight, and the snowmaking team is gearing up for another run. We'll have details of where they're heading in the PM report, but rest assured we're keeping our foot on the gas to keep winter around as long as possible.</p><p>Later this month, come check out events like <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/bust-n-burn" title="Bust 'N' Burn | Sunday River, Maine">Bust 'N' Burn</a> and <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/spring-fest-weekend" title="Sping Fest Weekend | Sunday River, Maine">Spring Fest Weekend</a> with activities for everyone in the family.
