Afternoon Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: February 23, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 1:34 PM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>Temps sure did warm up today, and we're currently sitting in the low forties. The sun is out, the turns are soft, and it's a great day to check out our slopeside decks for some apr&egrave;s. A few trails opened throughout the day, including Lost Princess, bringing us to over 745 acres of open terrain. Today's the perfect opportunity to get started on those goggle tans.&nbsp;</p><p>Snowmaking will pause until Monday night with these warmer temps, but Mother Nature gave us a little assistance this morning. Our grooming team will be out and about tonight, and they'll be grooming the same list of trails as last night. As of this time, the Oz Quad is scheduled to spin tomorrow. The Quantum Leap Triple and the Jordan Mountain Double will both open at 8AM tomorrow. The Aurora Quad will remain on hold following a mechanical issue. Lower Airglow, Celestial, and Supernova will be closed, but Northern Lights, Lower Vortex, Paradigm, and Sensation will remain open.</p><p>It's never a bad time to review the Skier Responsibility Code. Take a moment, refresh yourself before heading out, and please remember to go slow in the base areas.</p><p><a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/presidents-week" title="Presidents' Week | Sunday River, Maine">Presidents' Week</a> schedule remains jam-packed.
