<h4><strong>April 9, 2023 |&nbsp; 6:30 AM</strong><strong></strong></h4><h4><strong style="font-size: 2em;">Morning Report</strong></h4><p>It&rsquo;s a beautiful morning here at Sunday River! Those participating in the Easter Sunrise Service at North Peak were greeted with a peaceful sunrise. The good news is that the clear skies and warm sun are here to stay throughout the rest of the day, which is the perfect way to round out a great ski weekend. &nbsp;</p><p>Last night, groomers were out on their usual trails. Snow conditions this morning are firm, but will soften up as temps are projected to rise to 40 degrees by 10AM and get into the 50s by noon.</p><p>Early this morning, Betty and Eddy shared that the Easter Bunny visited us through the night and left some goodies to be found around South Ridge Basin. The Easter Egg Hunt starts at 7:30AM and runs until all of the eggs are found.</p><p>From 11AM-1PM, we will be hosting our Annual Passholder Appreciation Lunch at South Ridge. The lunch is free for those with a valid 2022-23 or 2023-24 season pass.</p><p>For a list of all the events through the rest of the year, check out the <a href="https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fclick.e.sundayriver.com%2F%3Fqs%3D3532f2a14112686ff3a768d45cea46fed2baa3d90ab995ca3b2b943d4a7fd99da98093510009409456d0f3c73e27cfaf76fd14e473e7d94d&amp;data=05%7C01%7Ccommunications%40sundayriver.com%7C8d93f7c7dd5043d02a4d08db376097a7%7C20fea68a11ec4b24a9055061d8e916d0%7C0%7C0%7C638164660220742442%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=IkdZZJlOGo2Cph4oKEZ5WQbRNhGgDfcl%2BYw51Oadk%2BI%3D&amp;reserved=0">full schedule</a>.
