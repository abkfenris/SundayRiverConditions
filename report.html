<h4><strong>February 23, 2023 | 6:22 AM</strong></h4><h4><strong style="font-size: 2em;">Morning Report</strong></h4><p>Good morning skiers and riders, happy Thursday. Mother nature has finally provided us with a fresh blanket of February freshies. We are starting the morning with around 4" of snow on top of some freshly groomed terrain. The snow is still coming down, and there's no sign of it stopping soon.</p><p>Temps start the morning at around 15 degrees and stick below 20 for the rest of the day. Let's hope the snow keeps falling steadily for the rest of the day and into the night to add to our base and soften up our skiable surface. Quantum Leap Triple and Oz Quad will be closed today. As the day goes on, keep an eye on the mountain report as ski patrol assesses terrain and begins to drop ropes and reopen trails.</p><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">You might want to change your plans for the next few days and head up to western Maine for fresh snow and fun laps.
