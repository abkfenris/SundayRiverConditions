</p><p style="color: #696969; font-weight: 900; font-size: 12px;">WEDNESDAY, MARCH 17</p><div><p>Good morning Sunday River skiers and riders! It's a gorgeous day on the mountain. Our snowmakers were working hard the last few days to ensure we'd have some sweet snow to slide on, and our groomers spent the night pressing the trails beautifully. You have to check out Right Stuff, Sunday Punch, or Ecstasy today; freshly pressed stripes on yesterday's snowmaking - what could be better? Expect the snow to be springy and fun, especially as the sun warms everything up later on. It looks like Mother Nature is finally giving us a break as far as wind goes, so the Chondola cabins have been put back on for today. It's a perfect day to catch first chair at 9AM. And remember: it's St Paddy's Day! Break out your green outfits and make a reservation at the <a href="/x5392.xml">Foggy Goggle</a> or snag a spot at&nbsp;<a href="/resort-dining/barker-bar">Barker Bar</a> to celebrate.&nbsp;</p><p>Due to the shift to colder temps the last few days, most of our naturals will be closed. Looking ahead we have some warmer days in the forecast, so keep an eye out for ropes dropping over the next week.</p><p>Our <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/special-deals">Spring Fling Flash Sale</a> is live!
