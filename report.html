<h4><strong>March 12, 2023 | 6:30 AM</strong><strong></strong></h4><h4><strong style="font-size: 2em;">Morning Report</strong></h4><p>Happy Sunday morning! It is shaping up to be an absolutely gorgeous day on the hill today. Our team spread out over the resort overnight, smoothing out those skied-off runs and putting down the fresh corduroy we all look for in the morning. Trails are fresh, firm, and fast but will soften as the day progresses.</p><p>We are starting the day at a crisp 20 degrees this morning by first chair. As the day goes on, the sun should shine bright, and temperatures will warm up to the high 30s. No sign of much wind in the forecast, and all lifts are scheduled to spin. It will be easy to have a great day today as long as you spend it on the slopes in the heart of western Maine.
