<h4><strong>February 8, 2023 | 2:45 PM</strong></h4><h4><strong style="font-size: 2em;">Afternoon Report</strong></h4><p>Today's conditions held up great for another day of fantastic skiing and riding. Groomers were fast and easily held edges as the fresh snow gripped your turns. Warmer temps felt great as long as the wind stayed calm. Wind gusts around the mountain created cold zones and forced us to slow down a few lifts during the day. Nevertheless, there was still plenty of terrific terrain to ski and ride today. Guests certainly got out there early to take advantage of the warm temps and fresh corduroy.<br />Our team will be back on the mountain tonight, grooming out the usual trails cleaning up the terrain, and redrawing that beautiful corduroy we all look for. Snowguns will be turned on in a few areas overnight to build up our snowpack and prepare to open up the last of our closed terrain. <br />Weather will be pretty mild once again, with temps starting the day around 25 degrees and reaching almost 40 here at the base by mid-day. Clouds should pass by throughout the day, but visibility should remain fair. With warmer temps coming our way, fresh groomers, and over 800 acres of open terrain, we hope you can make the trip up to enjoy a day with us soon here at Sunday River.</p><p>Catch you up there in the morning!<br />-Team Snow</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
