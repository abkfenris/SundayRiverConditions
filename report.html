<h4><strong>March 7, 2023 | 7:42 AM</strong><strong></strong></h4><h4><strong style="font-size: 2em;">Morning Report</strong></h4><p>Good morning everyone, and welcome to Tuesday on the mountain. Moderate temps are expected across the mountain today, making for some lovely, smooth turns across all 8 peaks. Thanks to all of the snow we've gotten recently, there are even some powder stashes left over for those willing to find them.</p><p>In the world of lift ops, the wind is looking significantly better today but still may have an impact on our ability to operate some of our higher summit lifts. Keep your eyes here for all of the most up-to-date info throughout the day.</p><p>As a reminder,&nbsp;<strong>2023-24 New England Passes</strong> hit the shelves tomorrow. Don't miss out on the chance to lock in your pass at the lowest prices of the year during our one week flash sale.</p><p>We'll see you out there!</p><p>- Team Snow</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
