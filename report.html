Head to the top of one of Sunday River's peaks for a cool breeze and phenomenal views of Western Maine, the White Mountains, and the Mahoosuc Mountains.<strong> Don't forget to bring plenty of water, sunscreen, a hat, suitable footwear, some layers,</strong> and some salty snacks to replace what you sweat out. Water bottle filling stations are located in South Ridge Lodge, as well as the hotels. The mountain received lots of heavy rain this week, so please be wary of washed-out trails.&nbsp;</p><p>Construction is nearly wrapped up on North Peak, but there may still be some heavy machinery in that area from time to time. Please be wary of large holes and don't hike alone if you are unsure of your abilities. If you are having trouble finding your way, please ask one of our knowledgeable lift operators or patrollers and they will be able to assist you!&nbsp;</p><p>Looking to take a trail less traveled? Trail B, accessible from the Jordan Hotel, sees far less foot traffic than some of our other trails. Please be aware of construction surrounding this trail, however, and <strong>please adhere to all posted signs and warnings</strong>. Do not cross orange ropes or enter areas beyond &ldquo;no trespassing&rdquo; or &ldquo;trail closed due to construction&rdquo; signs.</p><p>There are plenty of tables and chairs around North Peak lodge for you to enjoy a picnic lunch or sunny siesta with a view, but please remember to dispose of your trash and recycling at the top or bottom of the lift.</p><p><strong>Construction continues on Barker Mountain Rd.</strong> During the week, Monday - Friday, there will be limited access depending where the crew is working. Most access will be allowed via Cascade Hotel Hill Dr. Weekend traffic will flow as normal.</p><p>If you are injured or need assistance at any point, please contact&nbsp;<strong>Patrol at (207)-824-5350</strong>&nbsp;or visit our First Aid Clinic in the bottom of the South Ridge Lodge next to Betty's Treats and Treasures.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
