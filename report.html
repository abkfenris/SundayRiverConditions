<h4><strong>January 11, 2023 | 2:00 PM</strong></h4><h2><strong>Afternoon Update</strong><span></span></h2><p>Today taught us to never doubt our Mountain Ops team. Even with the cold temps overnight and today, conditions out there today were excelent.</p><p>The groomed-out trails were firm, but a layer of packed powder on top allowed edges to easily sink in and hold turns. Skiers and riders took advantage of this today as we saw huge carves and arcing turns throughout the resort. As the day continued, guns made snow over closed trails and a lower part of Barker. The team will turn on even more snow guns tonight and keep them on throughout the night and into the morning as long as cold temperatures remain. Our mountain ops team has taken a peak into the forecast and wants to be as prepared as possible for whatever weather is coming. Look out for snowmaking tomorrow in White Cap and Aurora areas until we loose temps to do so.&nbsp;</p><p>Groomers will get back out on the mountain tonight to push and groom all this freshly made snow and get those Sunday River stripes back onto the trails.</p><p>It looks like another cold day tomorrow with some clouds in the sky, potentially bringing us a fresh dusting of snow and light winds.</p><p>If you're in the area with your little ones tonight, don't forget to head to South Ridge for a fire show and fireworks to end another day of <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/kids-week.xml">Kids' Week.</a></p><p><strong>Please note:</strong> There is currently no beginner terrain into and out of the Grand Summit Hotel.</p><p>See you on the slopes!</p><p>-Team Snow</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
