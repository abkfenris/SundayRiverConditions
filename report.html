<h4><strong>December 24, 2022 | 6:45 AM</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></h4><h2><strong>Morning Report</strong></h2><p>Good morning, and Merry Christmas Eve! The team has been hard at work throughout the night recovering from yesterday's storm, so let's dive right into it.&nbsp;</p><p>First off, travel and road conditions. While we are very lucky to have escaped any major storm-related damage at the resort, we are dealing with disruptions to normal travel in the surrounding areas. This will impact our Teams ability to get to the resort throughout the morning. Due to this, lifts may have a delayed opening. We are working as hard as possible to get everything open as soon as possible, and are expecting efforts to increase in speed as more staff arrives at the mountain.&nbsp;</p><p><span>Currently, we have been made aware of road closures on Route 2 near the Rumford McDonald&rsquo;s, as well as downed wires on Intervale Road. Access via the Rumford side of the resort is also closed due to water over the road on Route 232 near the intersection with South Rumford. Central Maine Power is aware of the downed wires but does not yet have an estimate for removal. For those traveling in/out of the resort, the only way in/out of Sunday River is via the Bethel side of Route 2 East and Route 26 East.</span></p><p>We always talk about how great our grooming team is, but on nights like this, they really earn it. The cats took to the hill around midnight last night and did their best to resurface the mountain after the temps crashed. Reports from the hill are positive, but please keep in mind that conditions on all open terrain today will be on the firmer side of firm. We definitely recommend whatever pair of skis you currently have the sharpest edge on. The only open terrain today will be what the groomers were able to work on last night.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><span>Our goal is to recover from last night&rsquo;s rain as quickly as we can, but we also need to be mindful of everyone&rsquo;s safety. We will continue to update you with information as it becomes available to us. This is not the first storm we have weathered together as a resort community, and we are confident that we will return to normal operations very soon. In the meantime, thank you for your patience. &nbsp;</span></p><p>-Team Snow</p><p>&nbsp;</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
