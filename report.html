</h6><p style="color: #696969; font-weight: 900; font-size: 12px;">TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 2</p><div><p>1:20PM update: the Jordan Express lift is currently on wind hold. The Jordan Mountain Double will be open for ski-out access.&nbsp;</p><p>February, we like you already. Up to 12" of new snow piled up by mid-afternoon and it's a free refill kind of day out there. If this storm plays out as we hope, we could see well&nbsp;<strong>over a foot of snow.</strong>&nbsp;Head to trails like Black Hole and go find the goods in the woods for some untouched terrain. Ropes have been dropping left and right today and Last Tango, Hollywood, Emerald City, and Eureka opened up for the first time this season. Keep it up in the new snow and come back for first chair tomorrow to enjoy the leftovers.&nbsp;</p><p>This is a prime opportunity to take advantage of our<a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/booklodging?Checkin=2021-2-1&amp;Checkout=&amp;Adults=2&amp;Children=0&amp;Others=0#/room.xml">&nbsp;20% off midweek lodging sale</a>&nbsp;to stay slopeside and hop on first chair and enjoy shredding all day, or to plan ahead and lock in a room with our <a href="/special-deals/presidents-week" title="presidents' week sale">Presidents' Weekend &amp; Week Sale</a> ending this Friday.</p><p>Lifts will open at 9AM tomorrow, but the lift maintenance team will be working on the Little White Cap Quad, which will have a delayed opening. We hope you rested those legs, because this is going to be an awesome week. Please note that the cabins will remain off of the Chondola until this storm passes.</p><p><span>Please note we are&nbsp;</span><a title="Online Store" href="https://shop.sundayriver.com/s/lift-tickets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>requiring online lift ticket purchase</strong></a><span>&nbsp;and setting </span><strong>limits on the number of tickets</strong><span>&nbsp;sold for each day. This includes full-day, half-day, beginner, Threedom additional days, and Passholder Friend tickets. We only expect these limits to affect peak dates, but encourage everyone to buy early to ensure access on the dates you want. Season passes, Ikon passes, and lift ticket packs remain direct-to-lift with no restrictions or reservations.</span></p><p><span>Fast and contactless lift ticket pickup is available at our PUBs (Pick Up Boxes) at base lodges and hotels. Just scan the barcode at the bottom of your confirmation email and your RFID cards will print with your lift tickets or ticket packs loaded. For best results turn off dark mode on your phone if you use it and avoid email apps that use dark backgrounds.</span></p><p><span>Please remember to take a self-administered </span><a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/covid" title="Health Screening">Health Screening</a><span> and visit our&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/covid">COVID Winter Guide</a><span>&nbsp;before each trip to stay up-to-date on safety protocols and state guidelines.</span></p><p>Keep dancing!</p><p><span>Team Snow</span></p></div><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
