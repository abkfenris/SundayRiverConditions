<p><strong>December 10, 2022 | 1:15 PM</strong></p><p>The sun is shining, the skies are blue. Happy Saturday, Sunday River. What a day it was out there today. The groomers were fast and carved great, while the snow guns kept blowing, creating playful, soft piles of snow. It was great watching the parking lots fill up this morning as more skiers and riders hit the slopes. With seven lifts open and 26 trails, there was plenty of terrain and acreage to shred.</p><p>The cold temps forecasted for tonight and tomorrow will bring perfect weather for snowmaking and grooming out that perfect corduroy. Once the lifts stop spinning this afternoon, the mountain ops team will be back at it, creating new snow for expansion and grooming all over the mountain, smoothing out those snow piles in preparation for tomorrow.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>If you are around tomorrow, makes sure to head to South Ridge for<a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/santa-sunday"> Santa Sunday</a> and witness the biggest flash mob of Santa skiers and riders out there.</p><p>&nbsp;It's starting to feel like winter!</p><p>-Team Snow</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
