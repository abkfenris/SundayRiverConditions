Afternoon Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: December 25, 2023 </strong></em><strong>| 1:35 PM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>From all of us here at Sunday River, Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays.&nbsp;</p><p>For those who came out today, you were rewarded with some sweet conditions. They were creamy, buttery, and smooth, just what we hope for.&nbsp;</p><p>Alright let's get down to business and talk about tomorrow. Skiing out of <strong>South Ridge will be reopening tomorrow, </strong><a href="/lessons" title="SnowSports School">along with SnowSports School.</a> We will be operating South Ridge Express, starting at 10AM and the upper two magic carpets starting at 8AM. There will also be ski access from South Ridge to Barker and back, but it's going to be a little different.</p><p>Outta Here will serve as a multi-directional access point between South Ridge and Barker. On-hill construction is possible, and as such, we will have resort employees stationed at either end of Outta Here to help with the traffic flow. We understand this is a departure from the norm, and we appreciate everyone's flexibility as we continue to recover from the storm.</p><p>Please note that beginner terrain will only be accessible out of South Ridge, where other parts of the resort will be considered advanced terrain.</p><p><span>We have exciting events happening this week, from <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/fireworks">fireworks</a> to dinner with <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/winter-activities/eddy-and-betty-the-yetis">Eddy and Betty</a>. Check out our <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/christmas-vacation-weeks">events page</a> for the full list of fun for the whole family.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Please continue to check the Mountain Report for additional operational updates as we continue to navigate the coming days.&nbsp; Be sure to check out the <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/river-guide" title="River Guide | Sunday River, Maine">River Guide</a><a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/river-guide"></a>&nbsp;for a full list of current hours as we open more shopping and dining options, and remember to check with area restaurants and businesses for updated hours as they work to reopen following the storm.</p><p>Many, many thanks to everyone who has supported Sunday River through this recovery process. We wouldn&rsquo;t be here without everyone who helped.</p><p>We'll see you out there!</p><p>- Team Snow</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
