Afternoon Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: April 8, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 1:14 PM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>It's one of the best days of the year, no doubt about it. The sun is shining, the temps are soaring, and it's just incredible out there. We'll be out on the hill taking in the Eclipse, so hopefully we see you out there.</p><p>As a reminder, the White Cap Quad, Barker 6, Chondola (ski lane), Spruce Peak Triple, and Jordan 8 will shut down at 3PM for the eclipse. The Chondola will remain open until 3:20PM for foot traffic up to North Peak. At 3:45PM, the Chondola will reopen to download those who purchased scenic lift rides. All other lifts will reopen at 4PM and close for the day at 5PM, except for Spruce which will stop spinning at 4:45PM.&nbsp;</p><p>The party at North Peak is picking up, with the <a href="https://mainemineralmuseum.org/" title="MMGM">Maine Gem and Mineral Museum</a> offering some truly one-of-a-kind experiences! They will be hosting a raffle, and letting people hold a piece of the moon - yes, the actual moon! North Peak will be open for food and drinks, so get up there and start working on that goggle tan.&nbsp;</p><p>If anything changes between now and the eclipse, we'll update the Mountain Report with the most current information.</p><p>As a reminder, all new <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/season-passes">New England Passes</a> automatically qualify for immediate access all Spring long, so buy now, ski now, and maximize the value of your pass now!</p><p>We'll see you out there!</p><p>- Team Snow</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
