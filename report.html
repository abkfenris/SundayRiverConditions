Afternoon Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: February 12, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 3:06 PM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>Another Monday in the books. We had some amazing pockets of sunshine throughout the day that kept things nice and toasty. The weather ahead looks to be getting back to more normal February conditions. Snowmaking will kick back on tonight to resurface trails across the resort. The plan is to keep some of the guns running after 9AM tomorrow, so you'll likely encounter active snowmaking in the earlier morning hours as temps allow. We've got a slight chance of snow tomorrow, but our eyes have shifted to later this weeke to hopefully pick up some fresh accumulation heading into Presidents' Week.</p><p>And speaking of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/presidents-week" title="Presidents' Week | Sunday River, Maine">Presidents' Week</a>, it's right around the corner, and we have events planned for the whole family.
