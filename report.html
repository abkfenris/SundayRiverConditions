<p><strong>December 3, 2022 | 12:50 PM</strong></p><p>We arrived this morning optimistic the weather would hold off; however, mother nature decided to keep the temps too warm for the anticipated precipitation to be snow. It's just one of those days where you get your runs in and head inside for something to warm you up. <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/resort-dining/foggy-goggle" title="Foggy Goggle | Sunday River">The Foggy Goggle</a> is open until 5 PM, so swing through South Ridge for some refreshments. Tonight, as soon as the weather begins to calm down and temperatures drop below freezing, our team will get out there to create new snow for expansion and groom as much open terrain as they can. All signs point to crisp winter temps tomorrow, with low winds and periodic clouds throughout the day. With new trails opening daily, we are pushing to keep the most open terrain on the east.</p><p>Hope to see you out there tomorrow!</p><p>-Team Snow</p><p></p><p></p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
