<p><strong>November 28, 2022 | 12:52 PM</strong></p><p>Mother Nature ended up treating us pretty well today with some sun poking out this afternoon. As we look ahead at the weather, temps are forecasted to drop tonight which means our snowmaking team can fire back up and keep laying it down. As we are still in the early season, things can change in a hurry, so keep an eye on the Mountain Report for the latest trail conditions and general resort updates.</p><p>If you haven't checked it out already, head over to our <a href="/cyber-monday" title="Cyber Monday">Cyber Monday</a> page and snag some deals on lift tickets and lodging. The sale disappears on Wednesday, so don't wait!</p><p>&nbsp;- Team Snow</p><p></p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
