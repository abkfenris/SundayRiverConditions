<h4><strong>January 4, 2023 | 7:40 AM</strong></h4><h2><strong>Morning Update</strong><span></span></h2><p>Good morning Sunday River skiers and riders. Let's start the day off with some good news. Our Parks Crew has been hard at work for the last few days pushing snow and setting features. The bottom half of T72 will make its opening debut today with 14 rails, one jump, and one hip. These features are accessible via Ridger Run off of Escapade. The team will continue to push snow for the rest of the week to make progress in opening a top-to-bottom park as soon as possible.</p><p>The not-so-good news is the weather we have been experiencing recently is far from ideal. These warm temps throughout the day and night have impacted our snow depth and condition. Our Mountain Ops team has been working their magic to maintain a solid snowpack and provide a good skiing product for you. Check the trail report before heading onto the hill, as some trails were not groomed overnight to preserve snow and may be more advanced than usual.</p><p>Let's hope this unsettled weather turns to snow in the upcoming days as cold temps move into western Maine. If not, the colder temperatures will be just what we need to get our snowmakers back out on the hill to do what they do best.&nbsp;</p><p>Happy Shredding<br />-Team Snow</p><p><strong>Uphill access has now re-opened,</strong> but please check out our new <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/policies-and-safety">Uphill Policy</a> before taking to the slopes, as we've made some adjustments.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
