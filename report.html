Morning Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: March 29, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 7:35 AM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>We have some overcast skies this morning, with temps in the high twenties to low thirties. Temperatures should warm up throughout the day to high thirties up top and low forties down below. There's a chance of both frozen and unfrozen precipitation this morning, and we might feel a bit of a breeze this afternoon. Keep an eye on the lift and trail status below for the most updated info.&nbsp;</p><p>Our grooming team followed a limited grooming plan last night, and they laid stripes on 44 trails. All of the beginner trails on South Ridge and Little White Cap were groomed. There is at least one trail groomed top to bottom from every lift, including Lollapalooza, Northern Lights, Dream Maker, Risky Business, Lazy River, Cascades, and Jibe. Three Mile Trail and Bear Paw were not groomed last night, so there is no beginner groomed terrain off of Barker 6 or from the White Cap Quad. Things will be a little fast this morning, so sharpen those edges if you're out for first chair. White Heat will be closed to the public for Bust 'N' Burn training today.</p><p>Thinking about a season pass for next year? Buy now, ski now has officially started.
