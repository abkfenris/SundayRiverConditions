<h4><strong>January 21, 2023 | 6:30 AM</strong></h4><h2><strong>Morning Report</strong><span></span></h2><p>After 24 hours of snowfall, the clouds have begun to disappear, and the sun is shining bright. The forecast brings temps in the 20s, mild winds, and excellent visibility. It's a beautiful day here at Sunday River, and the mountain is patiently waiting for your arrival.</p><p>Groomers are parked after a long night's work pushing around all this fresh snow, smoothing our trails, and redrawing those perfect corduroy lines. Snow guns are running in a few areas of the mountain this morning and will continue to make snow as we take advantage of these colder temps.</p><p>After the snow we received, ski patrol was able to inspect trails yesterday and open them as the day went on. We are starting the day with 100 open trails for your choosing. Make sure keep an eye on the mountain report as ski patrol hits the slopes to inspect more trails and update the trail conditions and lift status.</p><p>PLEASE NOTE: Spruce Peak Triple will start the morning on hold as we work to fix a mechanical issue. We are hoping to get this lift up and running by the middle of the day today.&nbsp;</p><p>Have a great weekend, and we will see you on the mountain!<br />-Team Snow</p><p>&nbsp;</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
