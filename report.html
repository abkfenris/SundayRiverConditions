<h4><strong>March 24, 2023 | 7:30 AM</strong><strong></strong></h4><h4><strong style="font-size: 2em;">Morning Report</strong></h4><p>Well, yesterday was not what we wished for. Foggy, wet, misty, just nasty. Those brave and prepared enough to get a few runs in probably saw some good snow conditions overall, but the uncomfortable weather was not what we wanted.</p><p>Today is a new day, and groomers were out overnight fixing the mess. Temps never got too low last night, so things have yet to really freeze up. We expect conditions this morning to be firm up top and soften up at the base. The forecast is looking warm once again, in the 30s-40s. There will be partially cloudy skies and some winds in the area. Keep an eye on the mountain report for possible lift holds due to wind this morning. Natural terrain will begin the day closed, but ski patrol will open them once the snow has softened up enough.</p><p>We are seeing some exciting weather ahead of us for the weekend. Temps will drop, and clouds are coming through. Hopefully, everything lines up, and mother nature will provide us with one last hint of winter.</p><p>Today and Saturday mark the final weekend of <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/winter-activities/night-skiing" title="Twilight Skiing">Twilight Skiing</a>, so if you want some after-hours turns, this is your last chance.
