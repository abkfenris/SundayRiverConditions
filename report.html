Morning Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: February 1, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 7:35 AM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>Time flies when you're having fun, and somehow it's already February 1. Today we're expecting temperatures in the high twenties to low thirties, cloudy skies, and little to no wind. 13 lifts are scheduled to spin today for trails across all eight peaks. Who's ready to get out there? We sure are.&nbsp;</p><p>Our grooming team worked hard throughout the night, and they took care of just under half of our open terrain. Our beginner terrain, most of our intermediate terrain, and some of our advanced terrain were all groomed last night. Our snowmaking team blasted snow on White Heat last night, as well as on Lost Princess and the top of Monday Mourning. They also turned on the Broadway fans. Broadway will remain ungroomed. Please note that there will be crossing guards at trails junctions across Monday Mourning to facilitate event traffic.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/pride-weekend" title="Pride Weekend | Sunday River, Maine">Pride Weekend</a> starts tomorrow, and there will be events for everyone to enjoy. <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/presidents-week" title="Presidents' Week | Sunday River, Maine">Presidents' Week</a> is right around the corner, with fun in store for the whole family.
