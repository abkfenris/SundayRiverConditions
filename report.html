<h5>January 23, 2022</h5><p>We carved into Sunday morning on the slopes! Snow guns are now blasting on Escapade after making snow on 3D and Lazy River all weekend. Groomers are working across 8 peaks tonight, putting stripes on trails including Paradigm, and Lazy River where snowmakers made piles and piles of snow. Lifts are spinning until 3:45PM this afternoon to end your day with some great turns, and you can catch first chair at 9AM tomorrow morning. Look forward to forecasted flurries early this week, and a following snowy system in sight. We have lots of trails to choose from on the most open terrain in the East!</p><p>Please note that ski-in access to the Jordan Hotel requires the navigation of intermediate trails to reach Jordan Bowl.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Around the Resort</strong><o:p></o:p><a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/wicked-air-and-apres"></a></p><p><a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/senior-week" target="_blank" title="event details" rel="noopener">Senior Week</a> starts tomorrow, January 24-28!
