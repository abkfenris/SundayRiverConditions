Afternoon Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: March 10, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 1:39 PM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>The snow kept falling through this morning, and we have another solid base. The snow might be dense, but it's here to stay. We're measuring a little over 8" here in South Ridge, with reports of more over at Jordan. Thanks to this storm, we were able to open over 100 acres of terrain today, including naturals like Last Tango, Yetiville, and Blind Ambition. The storm did come with some surprise thundersnow this morning, but lifts were back up and running as soon as the lightning passed.</p><p>Our snowmaking team will be off of the hill tonight, and they'll be back in action tomorrow night. Our grooming team will be taking care of a similar list of groomed terrain as last night, and we can expect around 64 groomed trails tomorrow. They'll use this new snow to help resurface and patch trails this coming week. Tomorrow, we're slated to have 13 midweek lifts. Please note that higher winds are forecasted as this weather system moves along.&nbsp;</p><p>Here for some midweek turns this week?
