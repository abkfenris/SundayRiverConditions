Morning Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: January 24, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 7:35 PM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>Today, we're expecting temperatures in the low to mid-twenties, snow flurries, and over 700 acres of skiing and riding across all eight peaks. With new corduroy on over half of our terrain, hitting the slopes today would be a great way to break up the week.&nbsp;</p><p>Our grooming team took care of the usual lineup of trails last night, and they added Ridge Express into the mix. They continued to work on pushing out Obsession, as well as some other new terrain. Our snowmaking team was also hard at work last night, blowing snow on some upcoming terrain. We'll have active snowmaking on Lower Starlight today, so please be aware of that as you're skiing in White Cap.</p><p>We're officially into Senior Week, and we have a whole list of events, including a comedy show, live music, and karaoke.
