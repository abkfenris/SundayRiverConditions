Afternoon Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: February 19, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 1:58 PM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>What a day out there! Definitely had some gusty moments this morning, but we got all 18 scheduled lifts spinning pretty quickly. Temps were a touch chilly with the wind, but the sun was unbeatable and made a world of difference. Knock on wood, the wind shouldn't present as much of an issue moving forward through the Presidents' Week holiday period, but as always, we'll keep the Mountain Report updated if anything changes. Weather looks pretty stable this week with a chance for some snow later on, but it's not looking like a huge storm. Who knows, things can change in a hurry.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/presidents-week" title="Presidents' Week | Sunday River, Maine">Presidents' Week</a> is here, and we have a whole host of events.
