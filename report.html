<h5>January 11, 2022</h5><p>The benefit of these cold January Maine days is that it makes for beautiful corduroy. Today is just that. Perhaps start off with an extra cup of coffee and let the sun do its work before layering up and hitting the slopes. Speaking of corduroy, Wildfire and Southpaw saw the cats for the first time last night, pressing out beautiful lines top-to-bottom. If you need a warm-up, South Ridge and Barker base lodges are open. Or for something extra special, check out the new hot cocoa bar at <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/resort-shopping/bettys-treats-and-treasures" title="Betty's Treats &amp; Treasures">Betty's Treats &amp; Treasures</a> next to the South Ridge base lodge until 4:30PM today.&nbsp;</p><p>Through Thursday this week, the White Heat Quad and the Aurora Quad will not spin, but the terrain they service is open for <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/uphill-access" target="_blank" title="policy" rel="noopener">uphill traffic</a> with a valid lift ticket or season pass.
