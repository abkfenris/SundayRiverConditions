<strong>High winds are impacting our lifts today</strong></p><p style="color: #696969; font-weight: 900; font-size: 12px;">MONDAY, MARCH 29</p><p>It&rsquo;s the remix to the Commodores&rsquo; <em>Easy Like Sunday Morning</em>, instead, it&rsquo;s <em>Breezy Like Monday Morning</em>. We all know the remixes are never better than the original, and this wind sounds nothing like Lionel Richie. Today we are experiencing some gusty winds on the mountain, which is affecting many of our lifts, and the forecast shows an increase in wind speed throughout the day. Please take a look at the lift status below for live updates on our current holds.</p><p>Lifts are scheduled to start spinning at 9AM. Last night groomers laid down stripes on 60 trails for fast carving in the morning and soft snow in the afternoon. Looking ahead, the next couple of days look like stellar spring days plus, we are keeping our eyes on a potential snowstorm at the end of the week. Spring is a mixed bag here in Maine, well who are we kidding every season is, but spring might just take the cake.</p><p>Please note that due to today&rsquo;s weather, uphill traffic will not be permitted.&nbsp;</p><div><p>With operations open daily through April 24, there is plenty of ski season ahead.
