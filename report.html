<b>Full-day lift tickets are sold out for this Friday 2/19 and Saturday 2/20</b></p><p style="color: #696969; font-weight: 900; font-size: 12px;">THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 18</p><div><p>Don&rsquo;t press snooze this morning, there is soft corduroy ready for carving. Last night the groomers prowled the slopes as they pressed out pristine stripes. Hop on first chair at 8AM to make your mark across the blank canvas. Enjoy the peeks of sunshine today before the snow rolls in tonight. It looks like we could get a nice refresh on the slopes tomorrow with a couple of inches of snow, lining us up for another stellar weekend at the mountain. For some fun easy carving today, check out trails like Wildfire, Lazy River, Northern Lights, and Lollapalooza. If you&rsquo;re just learning, we suggest starting the day at South Ridge for the best beginner terrain. Work up your confidence with the different levels of surface lifts before hoping on the South Ridge Express.</p><p>Twilight skiing will continue tonight through Saturday for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/presidents-week">Presidents&rsquo; Week</a> with access to the Chondola and South Ridge Express until 6:30PM.
