Morning Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: February 28, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 7:35 AM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>The weather has certainly sifted from yesterday. We're currently experiencing some inverted temperatures on the mountain, with the peaks seeing 40 and the basins sitting at 36. Things will warm up more throughout the day, and by this afternoon, temps will rise out of the inversion. The sun is hiding today as we're experiencing some unsettled weather across the mountain, but don't let that stop you from getting out there. The Aurora Quad is back online, so head over that way for some celebratory laps.&nbsp;</p><p>Our grooming team hit all of the usual midweek terrain, and we're looking at corduroy on 81 trails today. Our snowmaking team was out last night, doing some maintenance and tidying equipment. They'll continue to watch the forecast for the next weather window, and right now, that seems like Thursday. Think cold, and think snow!</p><p>Have you checked out the new apr&egrave;s experience at the <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/winter-activities/alpeniglu-at-sunday-river" title="Alpeniglu at Sunday River | Sunday River, Maine">Alpeniglu at Sunday River</a>?
