Afternoon Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: November 22, 2023 </strong></em><strong>| 1:34 PM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>Oh, what a day. The first snow day of the 2023-24 season certainly did not disappoint, with over 7" falling across the mountain. Early turns were absolutely delightful, and the remaining snow made for a soft playground out on the mountain. The extra blessing? This snow is exactly what we needed to continue to build a base and expand.</p><p>For tonight, the snowmakers will be taking a well-deserved night off, while recharging the system. Temps are expected to fall back below freezing tomorrow evening, at which point we'll be back at it in force. Grooming will take to the slopes to resurface Rogue Angel and Lollapalooza. Excalibur is expected to remain open but will be ungroomed tomorrow.&nbsp;</p><p>It's shaping up to be an absolutely wonderful Thanksgiving out on the slopes, and we hope you join us. Don't forget to leave the cooking to us and visit Camp for <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/thanksgiving-dinner">Thanksgiving Dinner</a>. Chairs spin at 8AM tomorrow through Sunday for extra time on the slopes.</p><p>Please note that early-season, variable terrain will be present on all trails. Lastly, don't forget to check out our <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/early-season" title="Early Season Guide | Sunday River, Maine">Early Season Guide</a>.</p><p>As we approach Thanksgiving, we're kicking off our <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/cyber-sale" title="Cyber Sale | Sunday River, Maine">Cyber Sale,</a> with deep discounts on lodging, lift tickets, ticket packs, and other deals.
