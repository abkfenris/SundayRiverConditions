<h4><strong>January 27, 2023 | 2:30 PM</strong></h4><h4><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h4><strong style="font-size: 2em;">Afternoon Report</strong></h4><p>As the morning went on, the sun came out, and resort guests were ripping the fresh groomers across our eight peaks. Ski Patrol inspected trails and decided only to close a few ungroomed trails for your safety. Anything ungroomed or in the trees was firm on top with softer snow underneath if you were able to break through the crusty top layer. Groomers, however, were fast and fun as edges gripped the surface with ease.</p><p>Our team will return to the slopes after the last chair later tonight to groom the usual trails along the resort and prepare the mountain for a fantastic weekend ahead. Snow guns will turn on after skiing hours and make snow across trails such as Bear Paw, Cut Off, Rocking Chair, Over Easy, Prism, Express Lane, Broadway, and Quantum leap. This snow will allow our team to fill in some rough spots and surface this terrain with freshly groomed stripes.</p><p>Weather for the weekend looks relatively mild as winds will remain calm and temps will not drop too low during the day. Clouds will pass by throughout the day, creating some darker moments, but the sun should be out most of the time, and temperatures will reach up to the mid-30s by lunchtime.</p><p>We hope you can make it here this weekend to enjoy another few days of beautiful east coast skiing and riding across over 700 acres of open terrain.</p><p>See you at the top!<br />-Team Snow</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
