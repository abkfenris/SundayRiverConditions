<h4><strong>March 23, 2023 | 7:30 AM</strong><strong></strong></h4><h4><strong style="font-size: 2em;">Morning Report</strong></h4><p>Happy Thursday, fellow rippers and riders; This morning feels eerie as thick fog rolls through. We are experiencing some interesting weather so far today. Last night we got a little dusting of snow. This morning it's foggy and misty and has already warmed up to the mid-30s. Pack your clear lenses or even those safety glasses from the garage because the only thing difficult about today will be the visibility.</p><p>Snowcats got after it last night and groomed the usual mid-week trails perfectly smooth and ready for the day. Ski patrol decided to close all the natural terrain out of Jordan Bowl last night. They will head to these trails this morning to inspect the quality of the snowpack and hopefully open them up to the public reasonably quickly.</p><p>Although the fog is thick, it will still be best to get out here early to get some quick turns in before noon. There is a chance some unfortunate weather will appear this afternoon. Let's hope temps will favor us and winds will help push these clouds by quickly.</p><p>This Friday and Saturday mark the final weekend of <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/winter-activities/night-skiing" title="Twilight Skiing">Twilight Skiing</a>, so if you want some after-hours turns, this is your last chance.
