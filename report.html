<h4><strong>February 28, 2023 | 1:34 PM</strong></h4><h4><strong style="font-size: 2em;">Afternoon Report</strong></h4><p>Well, folks, it's snowing, and it's snowing hard. The early flakes this morning have continued to cover the mountain, with current totals sitting at just over 6". It's an excellent day on the mountain, and the snow isn't stopping anytime soon. Forecasts are calling for the wind down to come sometime through the night, meaning we are well on the way to nearly a foot of snow.&nbsp;</p><p>The grooming team will take to the hill tonight, smoothing in this fresh snow into a perfect corduroy jacket for the mountain. Don't worry though, there will be tons of soft stuff left behind for you powder seekers.&nbsp;</p><p>Keep the snow dances going, we're just getting started.</p><p>-Team Snow</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
