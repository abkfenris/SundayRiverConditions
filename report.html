The sun is lighting up the mountain on this beautiful winter morning, and snowmakers have been blasting guns all night to make piles of snow to shred. With a breeze in the air, please check our lift and trail status updates as conditions improve this morning. Looking ahead, groomers continue to put stripes on the slopes, creating a great week and weekend of skiing. Celebrate the holiday season here at Winterfest this weekend, with entertainment ranging from live music to fireworks for family and friends to enjoy. This Saturday, December 18, twilight skiing will be opening with tickets at $10 for all ages!</p><p>Jordan Bowl is opening by next weekend, at which point both hotels will feature ski-in/ski-out trails for your convenience.
