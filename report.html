Morning Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: January 29, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 7:20 AM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>This cloud that's parked itself over the mountain for the last few days still hasn't moved, but it has continued to deposit some flurries that we'll happily accept. Overnight we got a light and fluffy 2" that got processed in with the grooming and should make for a fantastic surface. The temps that were predicted to drop never really did, so snowmaking did what they could, but it wasn't the full-blown attack they were hoping for. You might encounter snowmaking around the mountain at higher elevations as the temps allow, but those run-ins should be pretty minimal.</p><p>Aside from that, it's business as usual. Grooming hit all the normal suspects and the snow quality is looking prime. Weather looks pretty similar to yesterday with mostly-cloudy skies and temps in the mid-high 20s at the peaks and a light breeze. Keep in mind the lower natural terrain might be a bit crunchy this morning due to yesterday's 30+ degree temps, so maybe give those a few runs to soften up before commiting, but upper natual terrain should be in pretty good shape right off the bat.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/pride-weekend" title="Pride Weekend | Sunday River, Maine">Pride Weekend</a> is next weekend, and <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/presidents-week" title="Presidents' Week | Sunday River, Maine">Presidents' Week</a> is right around the corner.
