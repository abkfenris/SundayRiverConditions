<h4><strong>April 17, 2023 | 1:50 PM</strong><strong></strong></h4><h4><strong style="font-size: 2em;">Afternoon Report</strong></h4><p>Another Monday in the books, and while on paper it may not have been the best day, the snow was soft and fun. Even though the unfrozen falling snow stuck around all day, it never really increased to much more beyond a mist so that was a big plus. Today was our last midweek day of operation, so we'll see you all here this Saturday and Sunday for the final weekend of skiing for the 2022-23 season!&nbsp;</p><p>Today we are spinning the Chondola and Spruce from 9am-4pm. The Chondola is more of an access point to Spruce, and while you're more than welcome to lap the Chondi, the better skiing is up on Spruce. Please also note that there is <strong>no access into Barker basin </strong>and we currently have<strong> no beginner terrain</strong>. The mountain will be closed Tuesday-Friday while we re-group for one more hurrah. Uphill access will be closed from Tuesday-Friday. We have a big summer of upgrades planned, which means lots of heavy machinery moving around the mountain.&nbsp;</p><p>We'll see you out there!</p><p>-Team Snow</p><p></p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
