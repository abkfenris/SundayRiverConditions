<h4><strong>March 1, 2023 | 2:30 PM</strong></h4><h4><strong style="font-size: 2em;">Afternoon Report</strong></h4><p>Everyone was out this morning taking advantage of the freshly fallen snow. It was not long before tracks filled the trails, and guests began to explore the woods in search for untouched powder. The sky may not have been blue bird, but it was still bright and clear for the day. Winds remained calm, unaltering our lift statuses, and it only got warmer as the day went on. The temps and sun kept the trails soft, and moguls began to build up the more skiers turn down the slopes.</p><p>Tonight our groomers will hit the slopes to create excellent skiing and riding conditions for us all to enjoy tomorrow. Powder days are known to be tough on the legs, but it's the day after a powder day that real east coast skiers know to go out for. Soft gripping groomers on trail and powder stashes to search for in the woods.</p><p>The weather will be cloudy tomorrow, but temps will be relatively comfortable, and there is even a strong chance for even for snow fall during the day and in the afternoon. It looks like another great day to get up here and explore all the terrain and snow our eight peaks offer from White Cap to Jordan; there is something for everyone to enjoy.</p><p>What has been your favorite trail recently?<br />-Team Snow</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
