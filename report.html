<h4><strong>December 25, 2022 | 1:28 PM</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></h4><h2><strong>Afternoon Update</strong><span></span></h2><p>Good afternoon everyone, and again, Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays from all of us here at Sunday River. It's been a beautiful day on the slopes so far, with comfortable temperatures and beautiful blue skies. We've come to expect nothing less, but the grooming team continues to exceed expectations, this time with some help from our snowmakers. Grooming will be back at it tonight, as we work to make the most of the snowmaking team's efforts. Thankfully, this cold stretch is expected to last for the next few days, which will allow a lot of snow to be made, and even start to cover some new terrain. Any guesses when White Heat comes online?</p><p>Tomorrow is the 26th, which means that the <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/jordan-8-grand-opening">Jordan 8 will open</a> for the first time. We are so excited to welcome you all to the Jordan Bowl for the first turns of the season. There are some important notes to keep in mind as we move through the morning. Parking at the Jordan Hotel is limited, and parking on the roadways is not permitted. Please allow yourself time to traverse the resort. First chair will depart the terminal at 9:30 AM. The Jordan Mountain Double will begin spinning at 8 AM, providing ski-out access from the Jordan Bowl. Most importantly, don't miss out on your chance to win a seat on the first chair! Details will be available in person, so make sure your at the bottom of the Jordan 8 by 9 AM.&nbsp;</p><p>We'll see you out there!</p><p>-Team Snow</p><p>&nbsp;</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
