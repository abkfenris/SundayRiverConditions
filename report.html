Afternoon Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: March 6, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 1:52 PM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>Today we had some soft turns under misty skies, with some playful bumps along the trails. The temperature inversion flipped, and temps in the base areas are sitting near 50, with the peaks staying around 45. Winds are light, and we're expecting similar weather tomorrow.</p><p>Our grooming team will be following a reduced grooming plan again this evening. These warmer temps are bringing some unfrozen precipitation tonight, and in an effort to preserve our snowpack, our grooming team will be laying stripes on just our beginner terrain. Despite these recent curveballs from Mother Nature, we still have over 500 acres of open terrain and 13 midweek lifts. Looking ahead, there might even be some frozen precipitation in the forecast, so cross your fingers and think snow.&nbsp;</p><p>While this weather pattern is certainly not ideal, we are in great shape for excellent end-of-March and April skiing, thanks to our dedicated snowmaking and grooming teams.</p><p><span>Be sure to check out the <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events">events calendar</a> for the lineup of activities and performances throughout the rest of the month.
