Afternoon Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: April 9, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 1:05 PM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>Another 10/10 day here in Western Maine. Spring skiing is in full swing and we're loving every second of it. From Barker to Jordan, there's not a bad turn to be had.</p><p>Grooming will again be out tonight working their magic with our remaining snow pack. We're still skiing and riding on nearly 600 acres of terrain, with everything from woods to parks on the menu.&nbsp;</p><p>The build for Pond-A-Palooza will begin tonight. Tomorrow, the South Ridge basin will have the beginnings of the snow structure. Patrol will have the area roped off with signage, so please heed all directions when navigating back to load the Chondola.&nbsp;</p><p>Please keep in mind our spring operations schedule as we move through the month. Midweek operations will only consist of Jordan, Barker, the Chondola, and Spruce, which means we no longer have true beginner terrain available. Our full Spring operations schedule can be found <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/spring">here</a>.</p><p>Ski-in access to the Grand Summit Hotel is still in play but keep an eye here for updates as the snowpack melts.</p><p>Looking ahead, we've got a weekend full of <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events" title="Events | Sunday River">classic Spring events</a>. Pond-a-palooza will be taking place on Sunday, with the Great Tailgate and Passholder Appreciation lunch on Sunday!&nbsp;</p><p>We'll see you out there!</p><p>- Team Snow</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
