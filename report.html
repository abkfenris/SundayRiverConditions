Morning Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: November 21, 2023 </strong></em><strong>| 7:05 AM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>The mountain sure looks good covered in white. Mother Nature joined our snowmakers in their efforts last night, dropping 4" of fresh snow across the mountain. Snow is forecasted to continue through the early afternoon, with the potential for another 2-4" of snow to fall throughout the day. Welcome to winter!</p><p>For today, we're planning on taking our first steps toward expansion. Excalibur is scheduled to join the trail count today, pending final approvals from patrol. If it opens, Excalibur will be ungroomed, natural terrain for experts only. Lollapalooza received a last-night groom, so fresh corduroy can be expected throughout the morning, but it is expected to bump up with the additional snow throughout the day. Rogue Angel received an early groom prior to the snowfall, making that your destination for some fresh turns.</p><p>In the world of terrain parks, we are planning to have a 4-feature park located at the bottom of the Excalibur. This will primarily be a hike park but will be available for ski access via Excalibur when patrol drops the rope.&nbsp;</p><p>Please note that early-season, variable terrain will be present on all trails. Lastly, don't forget to check out our <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/early-season" title="Early Season Guide | Sunday River, Maine">Early Season Guide</a>.</p><p>As we approach Thanksgiving, we're kicking off our <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/cyber-sale" title="Cyber Sale | Sunday River, Maine">Cyber Sale,</a> with deep discounts on lodging, lift tickets, ticket packs, and other deals.
