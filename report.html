<h4><strong>February 16, 2023 | 7:30 AM</strong></h4><h4><strong style="font-size: 2em;">Morning Report</strong></h4><p>Good morning everybody, and happy Thursday. It's a beautiful bluebird morning here in western Maine, but darn does it feel like spring outside. With the sun shining strong to start, the temps will remain around the mid-40s here at the base all day long. Gusty winds are forecasted but should begin to calm down by the middle of the day. Keep an eye on the mountain report, as some lifts may come on and off from wind holds throughout the day. Once the winds calm and the sun pokes through the predicted clouds, we will have a beautiful day ahead of us.</p><p>Our grooming team smooted out the mountain last night as they started up the slopes early in the evening. They redrew those stripes back onto our trails, ready for all to enjoy today. Spring conditions are surly around; however, be aware of firm, slick spots that may have formed in areas.</p><p>Heads up for all the park lovers out there; Lower T72 will be closed today to allow our parks crew to rebuild. Today is the day for soft spring-like laps and warm, comfortable temps. <span data-preserver-spaces="true"><a href="https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sundayriver.com%2Fbooklodging&amp;data=05%7C01%7Cmatthew.falconer%40sundayriver.com%7C9cd67ba4dfe24aceae8808db0f50cc2d%7C20fea68a11ec4b24a9055061d8e916d0%7C0%7C0%7C638120611930009704%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=SbnCdb3CVqZ%2FXqgSzIAJtkif%2BUWrgYVtqh214UkmSlg%3D&amp;reserved=0">One-night stays</a> are now available for Presidents' Week.
