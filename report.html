Operations Update</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: December 21, 2023 </strong></em><strong>| 10:00 AM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>Despite the significant impact of this storm on our state, it hasn't stopped Mainers from doing what they do best &ndash; rolling up their sleeves and getting the job done. Our heartfelt appreciation goes out to our dedicated line workers, first responders, and various state agencies for their collaborative efforts in restoring Maine.</p><p>We also want to recognize some of our own heroes. Despite facing power outages in their own homes, our lodging teams have gone above and beyond to ensure our guests are well taken care of. Simultaneously, our Food and Beverage teams have worked tirelessly to provide food for our team members and contractors. Their undeterred spirit and commitment is what makes our community shine, and we are fortunate to share these wins that bring us together.</p><p>Significant restoration progress has been made, including the installation of a temporary bridge at the Grand Summit. Our dedicated teams are working around the clock repairing road washouts, replacing culverts, and clearing debris from base areas. While ongoing construction remains across the resort, we kindly urge guests and the public to avoid the mountain and any areas affected by washouts. Currently, all trails, including uphill access, are closed.</p><p>Our tentative plan for this weekend is to be skiing out of Barker with the Locke Triple, Barker 6, and Spruce Triple, with Barker Lodge and cafeteria open. We do not expect to have skiing out of South Ridge this weekend, however the lodge would be open with parking and shuttles to Barker throughout the day. This plan will be finalized tomorrow by 9AM.</p><p>Access will be limited to season passholders, ticket pack holders, Ikon passholders, and guests with pre-purchased lift tickets. For those staying directly at the Grand Summit, Jordan, or Snow Cap Inn through the resort, Stay &amp; Save lift tickets will be available for purchase during your stay.</p><p>Please keep in mind, while we are excited to welcome guests back to the slopes, Bethel and the surrounding area is still recovering from the storm. Limited services will be available both in town and on the mountain. Please plan accordingly.<br /><br />Today, our goal is to start snowmaking before the sun sets. Marking another positive step forward, our grooming team worked through the night, preparing trails and beginning the next phase of our opening process.</p><p>As always, please continue to check the Mountain Report for future operational updates.</p><p>Thank you and we&rsquo;ll get through this together.</p><p>-Team Snow</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
