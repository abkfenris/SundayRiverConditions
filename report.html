<p><strong>December 2, 2021</strong></p><p>What a day! With fresh flakes flying, we opened the Spruce Peak Triple for the first time this season and reopened the Barker Mountain Express after a few days' hiatus. Join us again tomorrow for nearly 120 acres of skiable terrain from Locke Mountain to South Ridge from 9AM-3:45PM. While snowmaking is taking the night off, the grooming team will be cruising around the mountain tonight making fresh corduroy. It's looking to be a heck of a weekend with <a href="/events/demo-day" title="event">Demo Day</a> Saturday and over<a href="/events/santa-sunday" title="events"> 200 skiing Santas</a> on the slopes of South Ridge on Sunday. Have you made your plans? Register for both events to make the most of your weekend.&nbsp;</p><p>All lift tickets need to be&nbsp;<a href="https://shop.sundayriver.com/"><strong>purchased online in advance</strong></a>. Have your RFID from last year? You can head straight to the lift! Skier services are available in both the Barker and South Ridge Lodges, as well as shuttle service between these lodges and the hotels while the lifts spin. We are now accepting cashless forms of payment only. Please be sure to have a gift card, resort charge, credit card, or debit card available for on-site purchases.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>COVID-19 Protocols</strong></p><p>Though we are no longer requiring guests to wear masks in general areas, we suggest masking indoors.
