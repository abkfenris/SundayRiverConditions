<p><strong>December 12, 2022 | 7:20 AM&nbsp;</strong></p><p>All 300 Santas, the one Grinch, and the one tree have packed their sleighs and headed back to the North Pole after an incredibly successful Santa Sunday yesterday! Their parting gift to us was perfect snowmaking conditions and a dusting of snow to go on top of your daily corduroy. Conditions this morning look excellent, with temps staying low enough throughout the day for snowmaking to remain active on a handful of trails, and a bright blue sky throughout the day.</p><p>Please be advised that <strong>Locke will not spin</strong> during the week. The terrain park on Upper Sunday Punch remains open as a hikable option, accessed from Jungle Road off of Barker.</p><p>Enjoy the conditions today and think snow!</p><p>-Team Snow</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
