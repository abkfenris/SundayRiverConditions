Morning Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: December 24, 2023 </strong></em><strong>| 6:35 AM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>Merry Christmas Eve, folks!</p><p>Today, we are going to be skiing and riding on over 130 acres, with trails from Spruce Peak to White Cap for your enjoyment. The grooming team has been on the hill all night continuing their excellent work. While all open terrain received a fresh groom last night, there is still no beginner terrain available at this time. Our snowmakers have been hitting it hard overnight and will continue to do so as long as temperatures cooperate.</p><p>Our Mountain Ops has been hard at work, in tandem with outside contractors, working to repair storm damage in South Ridge and Jordan. We're happy to report that progress has been swift, and more terrain is expected to come online soon. Stay tuned for an update on that today.</p><p>Today and into this week, we&rsquo;ll be offering trail-accessible dining at the Barker Food Court and the Barker Bar. Although we aren&rsquo;t currently skiing or riding out of South Ridge, the South Ridge Food Court, Foggy Goggle, and the Coffee Hound will all be open. Be sure to check out the <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/river-guide" title="River Guide | Sunday River, Maine">River Guide</a><a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/river-guide"></a>&nbsp;for a full list of current hours as we open more shopping and dining options, and remember to check with area restaurants and businesses for updated hours as they work to reopen following the storm.</p><p>Many, many thanks to everyone who has supported Sunday River through this recovery process. We wouldn&rsquo;t be here without everyone who helped.</p><p>We'll see you out there!</p><p>- Team Snow</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
