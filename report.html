Morning Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: January 19, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 7:33 AM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>It&rsquo;s going to be another chilly one today, folks, so bundle up before heading out. Temps are in the single digits right now. Base areas will warm up to the mid-teens throughout the day, and it'll likely stay in single digits or low teens up top. Skies will be mostly sunny, and winds should be variable but light. We have almost 700 acres of skiable terrain today, so get out there and get after it.&nbsp;</p><p>Our snowmakers are loving these temperatures, and last night they hit trails including Rocking Chair, Obsession, Snowbound, and Broadway. Please be aware that there will be active snowmaking on Upper Sunday Punch, Jungle Road, Cascades, and American Express throughout the day.&nbsp; Lazy River will be closed today. Check back here for the most updated trail and snowmaking status. Our grooming team cleaned up our usual trails, laying stripes on half of our open terrain and adding Jibe back to the list.</p><p>We&rsquo;ve got fun for the whole family this weekend, including a limited-time deal on single-night stays at the Jordan Hotel, available this weekend only. Don&rsquo;t forget to take a look at our lineup of live music tonight; Kevin Roper will be at the Foggy Goggle tonight from 3-6PM, and Darren Bessette will be at Shipyard from 5-8PM. In addition to more <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/apres-and-nightlife" title="Apres and Nightlife | Sunday River, Maine">live music</a> on Saturday night, check out the new apr&egrave;s experience at the Alpeniglu at Sunday River.
