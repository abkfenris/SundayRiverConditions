<p><strong>February 18, 2022</strong></p><div><p>What&rsquo;s that saying? Slopeside showers bring March powders? Today is going to be an interesting one. Groomers are focusing on South Ridge and beginner terrain off each peak, but a lot of terrain will remain ungroomed in anticipation of temps getting colder. That drop in the mercury always comes with wind so we're going to start the day off with some holds in upper elevation lifts. The good news is that no other grooming team compares to us when it comes to snow recovery after a freeze-thaw cycle. Mother Nature is going to chip in a bit with flurries this afternoon (up to 2"?), plus the snowmaking team is eyeing another refresh. With sunshine expected this weekend, and another possible snowstorm next week, we're pretty excited for what's to come. For today, we don't blame you if you'd rather sleep in.</p></div><p><strong>Around the Resort</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/presidents-week.xml" title="event listing">Presidents' Week</a> festivities start tonight.
