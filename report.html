<h5>January 9, 2022</h5><p><span>Starting the day off with some snow is exactly what we like to hear. This morning we should be seeing some snow showers that should last until the afternoon making the snow even more shredable. Overnight our amazing snowmaking team blew snow on Barker Mountain and all over Aurora Peak including some of the steep ones like Vortex and Black Hole. White Heat is groomed top to bottom so make sure you get over there first thing to get the blood pumpin'.&nbsp; For all you thrill seekers, T72 will be getting a little make over to keep you on your toes. So get up, get ready and go have some fun!</span></p><p>Both hotels are now ski-in/ski-out for your convenience. When skiing into the Jordan Hotel, beginner terrain is limited to Jordan Bowl via Lollapalooza, and skiing in from a different peak requires the navigation of intermediate trails. Please note that we have low or no inventory on certain services such as snowboard rentals, and some lesson products.</p><p><strong>Around the Resort</strong><o:p></o:p></p><p>Looking for a last-minute getaway?
