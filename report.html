Morning Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: April 10, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 7:30 AM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>Good morning, and happy Wednesday. The sun is just beginning to peek through the clouds, and our mountain is looking as beautiful as ever.&nbsp; Trail groomers worked through the night to clean up and smooth out all those skied-up trails from days prior. Thanks to their efforts, trail conditions will be excellent early in the day, gradually softening as the day progresses and clouds start to roll in.</p><p>Please be cautious while skiing into the South Ridge basin. Active construction is going on in preparation for<a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/pond-a-palooza"> POND-A-PALOOZA</a>. Please ski towards our Surface Lifts and around the South Ridge Express to access the Chondola entrance.</p><p><strong>Spring operations schedule:</strong></p><p>Midweek operations will only consist of Jordan, Barker, the Chondola, and Spruce, which means we no longer have true beginner terrain available. Our full Spring operations schedule can be found <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/spring">here</a>.</p><p>Ski-in access to the Grand Summit Hotel is still in play but keep an eye here for updates as the snowpack melts.</p><p>Looking ahead, we've got a weekend full of <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events" title="Events | Sunday River">classic Spring events</a>. Pond-a-palooza will be taking place on Sunday, with the Great Tailgate and Passholder Appreciation lunch on Sunday!&nbsp;</p><p>We'll see you out there!</p><p>- Team Snow</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
