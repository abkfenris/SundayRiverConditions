<h4><strong>January 3, 2023 | 7:35 AM&nbsp;</strong></h4><h2><strong>Morning Report</strong><span></span></h2><p>The hits keep on coming, and we're not talking about your uncle's smooth jazz album coming out next month. After a productive couple of days for the snowmakers, the system will be coming offline throughout the day as we go through another warmup. Unsettled weather is expected to move in tonight, but at least this time, there's some hope on the backside. Whatever precipitation falls at the beginning of this storm system is expected to turn to snow on the tail end as cold temps flood into Western Maine. We're not betting on anything yet, but some forecasts have local amounts of 4-6" in the mountains, so let's just say we've been snow-dancing since yesterday.</p><p>Regardless of snow totals at the end of this storm, forecasts indicate a prolonged stretch of cold that will allow our snowmakers to get after it and do what they do best - make winter happen. We're proud to have the most open terrain in New England, and don't have any plans of slowing down.&nbsp;</p><p>We'll see you out there!</p><p>&nbsp;-Team Snow</p><p><b>UPDATED Uphill Policy</b><span>: Uphill travel is NOT</span><span>&nbsp;permitted until further notice.&nbsp;</span></p><p></p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
