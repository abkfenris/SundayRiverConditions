<h4><strong>February 8, 2023 | 7:30 AM</strong></h4><h4><strong style="font-size: 2em;">Morning Report</strong></h4><p>It was a beautiful sight to wake up to a little fresh dusting of snow this morning. The mountain received a good 1-2" overnight, making for a great day to be on the hill. <br />Temps are rising today, ranging in the mid-30s and not changing soon. Overcast skies and light winds will ad a slight chill, but it should be a reasonably mild one here in Western Maine. <br />Our Team was out on the hill last night doing their thing, making snow until the temps no longer allowed. Spreading out over our eight peaks, the snow cats groomed out our usual trails for yet another day of skiing and riding. With fresh snow, warm temps, and over 800 acres of open terrain, what else could you ask for on a Wednesday?</p><p>We'll see you at the top!<br />-Team Snow </p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
