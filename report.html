<p><strong>December 4, 2022 | 7:00 AM</strong></p><p>The operations team worked double time last night and this morning to ensure freshly groomed corduroy on all open terrain. Once the temps allowed for it, snow guns were set to full blast, preparing for the expansion of new trails. Temps will remain moderate throughout the day; however, strong winds are present this morning, and our lift team is working hard to assess our lifts' availability. Due to this, the Chondola, Spruce Peak Triple, and Barker Mountain Express will start the morning on wind hold. Winds are forecasted to diminish throughout the morning, and we'll be standing by to get these lifts spinning as soon as it is safe to do so.</p><p>If you are here early this morning, take your time, grab a hot drink and a cinnamon bun at <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/base-lodges/barker-lodge" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Barker lodge</a>, or have a full breakfast at <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/resort-dining/camp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Camp</a> in the Grand Summit hotel. By late morning the wind will be calm and the sun will be shining, the perfect time to get out there for the rest of the day.&nbsp;</p><p>We will see you out there!<br />-Team Snow</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p></p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
