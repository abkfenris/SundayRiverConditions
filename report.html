<p><strong>December 15, 2022 | 1:45 PM</strong></p><p>It was a fantastic day to get outside and sink those edges into the snow. The soft surface and smooth-flowing trails allowed for a beautiful day of skiing and riding, dialing in that technique before the storm approaches.</p><p>The Mountain Ops team will be back to it overnight, blowing more snow onto closed terrain in preparation for expansion. They will send the snow cats out in the early morning to groom that perfect corduroy throughout the rest of the resort. The South Ridge team will focus their attention on Sundance and Double Dipper to create as much beginner terrain as possible for the weekend and get those surface lifts running and ready.</p><p>On the hill today, the word is out. Snow is coming! While exploring and checking out the terrain, I kept overhearing, "This will all be white after the weekend," or "Let's hope we can get all these trails open after this storm!" The anticipation is too much. Tomorrow looks like the start of it, with temps just below 33 degrees throughout the day and 3-5 inches of snowfall expected before sunset. With more snow forecasted for the weekend, don't forget to pack those goggles and maybe an extra balaclava. If you need more layers or better eye protection, make sure to head to<a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/sunday-river-sports"> Sunday River Sports</a> at South Ridge to get kitted out and be better prepared on the hill.</p><p>With all the storm excitement and anticipation, we almost forgot about <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/winterfest-weekend">Winterfest</a>! Check out everything we have going on this weekend to celebrate winter and kick off our 2022-2023 season.</p><p>See you out there!<br />-Team Snow</p><p></p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
