</p><p style="color: #696969; font-weight: 900; font-size: 12px;">SATURDAY, MARCH 27</p><p>Mother Nature rolled through overnight and brought along with her some cool temps. Our grooming team hit the slopes to press stripes on 70 trails and took a few extra laps this morning to work their magic. Expect fast and firm turns this morning that'll soften up throughout the day with sunshine peeking out as you make your way across the mountain. For some easy-going weekend carving, head to trails like Dream Maker, Escapade, and Lollapalooza. Lifts are scheduled to spin from 8AM-4PM and don't forget to celebrate the weekend with a fireworks show tonight at 7:30PM at South Ridge.</p><div><p>With operations open daily through April 24, there is plenty of ski season ahead.
