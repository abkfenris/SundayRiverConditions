<h4><strong>February 16, 2023 | 3:14 PM</strong></h4><h4><strong style="font-size: 2em;">Afternoon Report</strong></h4><p>It's been a whirlwind, but we are so excited to announce the <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/barker-6" target="_blank" title="Barker 6 | Sunday River" rel="noopener">Barker 6 </a>in addition to a litany of other upgrades coming as part of the <a href="2030.sundayriver.com" title="2030 | Sunday River">Sunday River 2030 Plan</a>. It's an incredible time to be here at Sunday River.</p><p>In other news, what a fantastic day of spring trail conditions. Too bad it's the middle of February, and these temps will not last long. The snow softened up quickly as long as the sun reached it. Tonight things will get groomed out as best as possible, as the overnight cold will certainly firm up the wet mashed potatoes we had today. Our team will be picky about when the groomers will hit the mountain to allow for the best surface to groom for tomorrow. The mountain ops team knows when will be best for the trails to be groomed to stop freezing over and maintain as much snowpack as possible</p><p>Tomorrow's weather does not look in our favor as temps will be in the mid-30s, and there is a fair chance of some precipitation in the morning. Let's hope the air can stay cold enough to keep this moisture somewhat snow-like and eventually turn it into so as temps begin to drop after the day of skiing tomorrow.</p><p>As we kick off Presidents week, check out everything we have going on throughout our resort. From Twilight Skiing all week long to Live bands and entertainment, there is always something going on during the holidays here at Sunday River. We are seeing some good signs of snowfall at some point later next week, which is a great reason to take advantage of our <a href="https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sundayriver.com%2Fbooklodging&amp;data=05%7C01%7Cmatthew.falconer%40sundayriver.com%7C9cd67ba4dfe24aceae8808db0f50cc2d%7C20fea68a11ec4b24a9055061d8e916d0%7C0%7C0%7C638120611930009704%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=SbnCdb3CVqZ%2FXqgSzIAJtkif%2BUWrgYVtqh214UkmSlg%3D&amp;reserved=0" style="font-size: 9pt;">one-night stays</a><span style="font-size: 9pt;">&nbsp;now available for Presidents' Week.
