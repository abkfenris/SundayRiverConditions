LIFT TICKETS ARE SOLD OUT FOR TODAY</h6><p style="color: #696969; font-weight: 900; font-size: 12px;">SUNDAY, JANUARY 17</p><p>Yesterday we were very lucky with a storm that brought us 6-9&rdquo; of new snow with very little mixing. Skiers and riders enjoyed free refills all day on the slopes. Last night the groomers pressed out the new snow for fun and fast corduroy today. Keep it up out there and enjoy the peeking sunshine. Don't get too tired, because we get to do it all over again tomorrow. With the holiday, lifts will start spinning at 8AM Monday. Come grab first chair and carve up the corduroy on all eight peaks. Now that each peak is open, there is a lot of terrain to explore.&nbsp;</p><p>Mother Nature was good to us yesterday, but today she is giving us some gusty wind as the tail end of the storm sweeps through. In preparation, our team has removed the cabins off of the Chondola to give us a better chance of avoiding a wind hold.</p><p>Please note that we are experiencing high call volume in our call center and guest services, so we recommend using our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/booklodging" style="font-style: inherit;"><strong>online booking engine</strong></a>&nbsp;for lodging reservations or quotes. Both of our resort hotels are ski-in/ski-out with access to beginner terrain.</p><p>There are plenty of food options around the resort for spreading out, but please remember that capacity is limited. Take a look at the <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/river-guide">River Guide</a> to discover locations, hours, online ordering, and how to make a reservation. For any needs such as season pass pickup, shopping, tuning, rentals, and SnowSports School, head to South Ridge Lodge.</p><p>For the safety of our team members and guests, we are&nbsp;<a title="Online Store" href="https://shop.sundayriver.com/s/lift-tickets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>requiring online lift ticket purchases</strong></a>&nbsp;and setting <strong>limits on the number of tickets sold</strong> for each day. This includes day, half-day, beginner, Threedom additional days, and Passholder Friend tickets. We only expect these limits to come into play on peak dates, but encourage everyone to buy early to ensure access on the dates you want. Season passes, Ikon passes, and lift ticket packs remain direct-to-lift with no restrictions or reservations.</p><p>Fast and contactless lift ticket pickup is available at our PUBs (Pick Up Boxes) throughout the resort. Just scan the barcode at the bottom of your confirmation email and your RFID cards will print with your lift tickets or ticket packs loaded. For best results turn off dark mode on your phone if you use it and avoid email apps that use dark backgrounds.</p><p>Before each trip to the slopes, make sure you visit our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/covid">COVID Winter Guide</a>&nbsp;to make a plan for your visit and stay on top of any potential changes.&nbsp;</p><p>See you tomorrow!</p><p>- Team Snow</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
