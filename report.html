Afternoon Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: March 31, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 1:57 PM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>Bust 'N' Burn is back for those who can take the Heat. The Dual Mogul Championships took place on White Heat today, where we got to see all of our favorite athletes run the bumps. With sunny skies, warm temps, and soft snow, it was a great day to feel the burn. If you didn't make it out today, don't worry- tomorrow is more of the same. Don't get used to it though, because there's a chance for another storm later this week. Cross your fingers and think snow!</p><p>Our grooming team will lay corduroy on a similar list of trails as last night except for Merrill Hill trails and Three Mile Trail. Check out the lift and trail status below for the most updated information. Tomorrow, check out more advanced terrain across the mountain like Upper Cut and Caramba, or take some more relaxed turns on trails like Mixing Bowl and Aludra.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Looking ahead, we've got <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/spring-fest-weekend" title="Spring Fest Weekend | Sunday River, Maine">Spring Fest Weekend</a> coming up, and don't forget to check out the details for our <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/eclipse-party" title="Solar Eclipse Viewing Party | Sunday River, Maine">Solar Eclipse Viewing Party</a>.
