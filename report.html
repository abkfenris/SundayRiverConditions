Kick off the morning with fresh pressed corduroy across 60 trails and then ski the soft snow through the afternoon. It's time to get those bump legs ready and our groomers are setting you up for success by leaving some trails ungroomed. Head over to Right Stuff, Tempest, Airglow, and Excalibur this afternoon for some untouched, classic spring conditions. Hop on first chair at 9AM and continue to enjoy the soft snow and sunshine all week.</p><p>Please note that the White Heat Quad will be closed today while our team works on a mechanical issue.&nbsp;</p><div><p>With operations open daily through April 24, there is plenty of ski season ahead.
