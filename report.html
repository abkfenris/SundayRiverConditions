Tickets are sold out for Saturday but still available for Friday and Sunday</h6><p style="color: #696969; font-weight: 900; font-size: 12px;">WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 3</p><div><p>Mother Nature delivered yesterday, dropping 14" of fresh snow. You know what that means? Terrain expansion and plenty of powder stashes to seek out today! This morning, we opened with nearly 100 percent of our terrain available, including notable naturals like Last Tango, Hollywood, Emerald City, and Eureka. But if groomed terrain is more your speed, the snowcats churned that fresh snow into gorgeous corduroy on 72 trails. For all our park riders: ropes dropped on Wonderland Park today. Lift close at 4PM; there are still a few more hours to sneak in some laps!</p><p>Lift tickets are sold out for Saturday, and filling up quickly for Friday and Sunday so make sure to buy yours soon. And don't forget that&nbsp;resort lodging guests can always purchase tickets at the front desks of their property, even when we're sold out.
