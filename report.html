Afternoon Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: January 21, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 1:11 PM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>The winds of this morning settled down by midday, and now we're skiing and riding on all 17 scheduled lits and 713 acres of terrain. There are no Sunday blues here, just the bright blue sky. What a way to end the weekend.&nbsp;</p><p>Our snowmaking team will finish making snow on Obsession tonight, and they'll continue to work on terrain in the surrounding area. The temps are chilly, but they're great for making snow. Our grooming team will push out Upper Sunday Punch and American Express, so get those last whaleback laps in this afternoon. The grooming team will also lay down corduroy on our usual lineup of trails. Our parks team will be building out T72 this week, with a tentative opening date set for this weekend. Rocking Chair will be in the works soon, and they plan on working on Starlight after T72.&nbsp;</p><p>This coming week is Senior Week, and we have a whole list of events, including a Cinabun Social, musical bingo, a comedy show, and karaoke.
