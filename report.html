<h4><strong>February 27, 2023 | 7:25 AM</strong></h4><h4><strong style="font-size: 2em;">Morning Report</strong></h4><p>Good morning and happy Monday to all you skiers and riders. Well, the sun is shining, the temps are a bit warmer, and we've got some bright blue sky happening right now. Basically, a recipe for a perfect day. Plus, the 2" of fluffly stuff that fell throughout the afternoon yesterday has now been groomed in and the surface today should be excellent. Snowmaking kept the guns shut off last night, but grooming got right to it. All the usual suspects should be dressed in their finest corduroy.&nbsp;</p><p>Items worth noting: T2 and Monday Mourning will be open today. Additionally, the terrain parks will be ungroomed but still open and accessible.&nbsp;</p><p>The weather looks *chefs kiss* perfect. Bright sun, temps hitting the low-20s, and some great snow to explore across all our peaks. And even though we're quickly approaching March, winter isn't done yet. We've got a couple of systems moving in that we're watching for some midweek snowfall. So if you've got any rituals that call for snow, now's the time to do them.</p><p>See you out there!<br />-Team Snow</p><p></p><h3><strong>A Note:</strong></h3><p>We love that our guests are exploring new terrain while enjoying the beautiful views and spectacular homes on Merrill Hill and The Glades. With that in mind, we ask that all guests be respectful of the private property directly adjacent to groomed surfaces by avoiding venturing off trail and staying within the boundary lines of the resort. Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
