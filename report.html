<p><strong>February 8, 2022</strong></p><p>Over 2 feet of flakes have covered all 8 peaks in the past week! The flurries are still flying as Mother Nature tops off our trails with 5-8&rdquo; of new snow. Take a new run each time, with all 135 glades and trails open for you to have lots of options. After three weeks we already have 53&rdquo; of accumulation, making for fantastic conditions across the mountain. Groomers are putting stripes on nearly 90 trails for you to carve into tomorrow morning at 9AM first chair. Explore a total of almost 2,000 acres to take tree skiing turns with our <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/boundary-to-boundary">boundary-to-boundary skiing</a>. As the snowy system rolls out of town later this afternoon, we could expect some winds to impact lifts before last chair. Please check the lift and trail status as we keep you updated while the flurries fly. Ski through your week on piles of fresh snow!</p><p><strong>Around the Resort</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/presidents-week.xml">Presidents' Week</a> is less than two weeks away!
