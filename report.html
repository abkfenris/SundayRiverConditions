<strong>Gusty winds are affecting our lifts this morning. Please look at lift status for updates.</strong></p><p style="color: #696969; font-weight: 900; font-size: 12px;">MONDAY, MARCH 15</p><div><p>Yesterday marked the return of winter with all-day snowmaking and Mother Nature sending down huge flakes of fresh snow giving us 1-2&rdquo; at the base and 4&rdquo; accumulating on our higher peaks. With these unseasonable temps, snowmakers are taking full advantage and lighting up the slopes with snow. This weekend White Heat had a nice resurface and last night the guns were going on Right Stuff, Risky Business, Tourist Trap, and Lower Mixing Bowl. The groomers were also out and about last night laying down stripes for fast carving today.</p><p>Lifts will start spinning at 9AM. We are currently experiencing some wind this morning, resulting in some of our higher elevation lifts starting the day on wind hold. Check in on lift status below before hitting the slopes for live updates. Please note that due to the lingering winds today, the Chondola cabins will remain off. With lifts on hold, there is no ski-in/ski-out access from the hotels. There are free shuttles available to get you to and from any hotel, lodge, or parking lot.</p><p><span>The <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/season-passes" title="Season Passes">2021-22 New England Pass is back on sale</a>, granting access to Sunday River, Loon &amp; Sugarloaf all next year.
