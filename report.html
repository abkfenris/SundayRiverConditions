LIFT TICKETS ARE SOLD OUT FOR SATURDAY, JANUARY 16 &amp; SUNDAY, JANUARY 17</h6><p style="color: #696969; font-weight: 900; font-size: 12px;">SATURDAY, JANUARY 16</p><p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline;"><span color="#333333" style="color: #333333;">The flakes have started to fall and forecasts are calling for about a half a foot of snow. It may or may not be a mix depending on elevation, so keep up the snow dances or whatever your superstition of choice may be. Groomers took to the hill overnight, pressing corduroy all across the resort for the new snow to layer up on and our snowmaking team is taking a well-deserved break, while Mother Nature rolls through this weekend. We're continuing to drop ropes and the Oz Quad is set to open for the first time this season at 10AM with Cowardly Lion. Expect White Heat, Downdraft, and Lost Princess remain ungroomed and filled with snowmaking piles to keep your legs working. Hop on first chair this morning at 8AM to enjoy falling snow and over 460 acres of terrain across all 8 peaks.&nbsp;</span></p><p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline;"><span color="#333333" style="color: #333333;">As we head into the long weekend, we are anticipating some winds at the tail end of this storm. In preparation, we removed the cabins off the Chondola to give us a better chance of avoiding a wind hold. We will be&nbsp;<strong>skiing and riding on all eight peaks</strong>&nbsp;this weekend and the Oz Quad will be running. Plus, there is more fun to be had over this&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/mlk-weekend">Martin Luther King Jr. Weekend</a>, including Indie Demo Day, twilight skiing, and fireworks with a fire dancer tonight.</span></p><p>If you're looking for a last-minute getaway, we still have resort lodging available this weekend. As an added bonus, <strong>all lodging guests are guaranteed lift ticket access, even when we are sold out like we are this weekend.</strong> Please note that we are experiencing high call volume in our call center and guest services, so we recommend using our&nbsp;<a href="/booklodging" target="_blank" title="Book Lodging " rel="noopener">online booking engine</a> for lodging reservations or quotes. Both of our resort hotels are ski-in/ski-out with access to beginner terrain and the Snow Cap in is a short walk or shuttle ride to the slopes.</p><p>There are plenty of food options around the resort for spreading out, but please remember that capacity is limited. Take a look at the <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/river-guide">River Guide</a> to discover locations, hours, online ordering, and how to make a reservation. For any needs such as season pass pickup, shopping, tuning, rentals, and SnowSports School, head to South Ridge Lodge.</p><p>For the safety of our team members and guests, we are&nbsp;<a title="Online Store" href="https://shop.sundayriver.com/s/lift-tickets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>requiring online lift ticket purchases</strong></a>&nbsp;and setting <strong>limits on the number of tickets sold</strong> for each day. This includes day, half-day, beginner, Threedom additional days, and Passholder Friend tickets. We only expect these limits to come into play on peak dates, but encourage everyone to buy early to ensure access on the dates you want. Season passes, Ikon passes, and lift ticket packs remain direct-to-lift with no restrictions or reservations.</p><p>Fast and contactless lift ticket pickup is available at our PUBs (Pick Up Boxes) throughout the resort. Just scan the barcode at the bottom of your confirmation email and your RFID cards will print with your lift tickets or ticket packs loaded. For best results turn off dark mode on your phone if you use it and avoid email apps that use dark backgrounds.</p><p>Before each trip to the slopes, make sure you visit our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/covid">COVID Winter Guide</a>&nbsp;to make a plan for your visit and stay on top of any potential changes.&nbsp;</p><p>Masks up!</p><p>- Team Snow</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
