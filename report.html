<h5>January 4, 2022</h5><p>It's a bright morning on the slopes, with freshly groomed terrain awaiting skis and snowboards. We are starting off the day with 69 open trails, the most in the East! Nearly 400 acres of terrain include 62 trails with corduroy to carve. Scheduled lifts are spinning from 9:00AM-3:45PM today. Looking ahead at the forecast, we have some potential fresh flakes incoming for tomorrow night, and a bigger system towards the Friday forecast. Until then, we'll be enjoying the ideal temperatures for snowmaking and grooming. Stay tuned as we look for flurries skiing into this weekend!</p><p>Both hotels are now ski-in/ski-out for your convenience. Please note when skiing into both hotels, navigating blue or more advanced terrain is required. At this time, there are no green trails accessible when skiing into the Grand Summit Hotel. When skiing into the Jordan Hotel, beginner terrain is limited to Jordan Peak via Lollapalooza, and skiing in from a different peak is currently considered advanced.</p><p><strong>Around the Resort</strong><o:p></o:p></p><p><a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/special-deals.xml" title="Dash Deals at Sunday River">Dash Deals</a> have hit the slopes this week!
