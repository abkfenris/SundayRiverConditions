<p><strong>April 3, 2022</strong></p><p>What a fantastic morning on the mountain! Blue skies and sunshine have warmed up the slopes as we ski nearly 400 acres of open terrain.

In the days ahead, Mother Nature is keeping the trails cool at night and warming slightly during the day so we can stay slopeside.
