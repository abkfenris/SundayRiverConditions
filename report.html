</p><p style="color: #696969; font-weight: 900; font-size: 12px;">SUNDAY, MARCH 14</p><div><p><span><strong>Last night the snow guns were fired up on the one and only, White Heat.</strong> The sweet sound of snowmaking once again filled the air and will continue throughout the day on Right Stuff. Grab morning freshies on White Heat or lap Right Stuff under the snow guns all day long. Groomers also hit the slopes last night to press out perfect stripes for another day of fun and fast carving. If you&rsquo;re just learning, start the day at South Ridge for access to the best beginner terrain.</span></p><p><span>Lifts will start spinning at 8AM. Some of our higher elevation lifts are starting the day on wind hold. The forecast shows an increase in wind throughout the day, so don&rsquo;t forget to check in on lift status updates before hitting the slopes. With the Jordan Bowl Express on wind hold, there is no ski back access to the hotel, but there are free shuttles to get you to and from anywhere on the resort. Please note that the Chondola cabins have been removed for the weekend due to the wind.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span><a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/master-of-the-mountain">Master of the Mountain</a> will be taking place today, so cheer on racers as they ski by to benefit the River Fund.</span></p><p><span>The <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/season-passes" title="Season Passes">2021-22 New England Pass is back on sale</a>, granting access to Sunday River, Loon &amp; Sugarloaf all next year.
