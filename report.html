Morning Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: March 25, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 7:23 AM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>How about that weekend?! Talk about overdue, right? We've gotten a whopping 36" of snow since Saturday, and that's making for some all-time conditions. Things didn't get too warm yesterday, so that bumped up snow should still ski nicely up in higher elevations (looking at you Jordan). If you hunt around, you might still even find some untouched pockets of powder for you to leave your mark on.&nbsp;</p><p>Grooming had a big job last night and did an awesome job processing all that snow into our surface. That cord today should be mint. Only real item of note is after grooming came through Jordan, snowmaking fired back up on Lollapalooza and Rogue Angel. Currently the guns are still running, so be advised as you're making your plans that there could be active snowmaking in the Jordan pod depending on the temperatures. Aside from that, weather looks lovely with highs reaching around 30, a light breeze, and sun. A nice way to celebrate the best conditions of the year.</p><p>Coming down the pipeline, we've got <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/bust-n-burn" title="Bust 'N' Burn | Sunday River, Maine">Bust 'N' Burn</a> this weekend!
