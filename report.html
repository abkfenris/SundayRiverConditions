<p><strong>February 13, 2022</strong></p><p>It's game on for snowmaking this Sunday! Guns are blasting on T72 and Right Stuff this afternoon. We are so excited for these frosty temperatures, as they are ideal for creating fresh snow. Groomers are putting corduroy on nearly 90 trails for 9AM first chair tomorrow morning. Look forward to taking turns on natural terrain, or carve into new stripes. There are so many events to enjoy leading into next week, including Super Bowl Sunday specials and Valentine's Day. The slopes are the best place to spend your Sunday, with over 100 open trail options. Stay tuned as snowmakers add to terrain for next week!</p><p>Little White Cap Quad will be closed for maintenance today and tomorrow. Please note at this time the Grand Summit Hotel is not accessible via beginner trails. All ski-in/out access to the Grand Summit Hotel temporarily requires navigation of intermediate and more advanced terrain.</p><p><strong>Around the Resort</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/super-bowl-specials.xml" title="Super Bowl Specials">Super Bowl Sunday</a> is here with specials for you to enjoy at Camp for the big game!
