<h4><strong>March 20, 2023 |1:27 PM</strong><strong></strong></h4><h4><strong style="font-size: 2em;">Afternoon Report</strong></h4><p>Today was the kind of day that makes you keep saying "what a day" on your drive back home. And what a day, indeed. The sun was shining the entire day and the groomed terrain was fast and grippy from the start. The ungroomed terrain took a bit of time to soften up, but the sun sure helped with that and made it much friendlier into the afternoon. It's looking as though we're going to lose the sun for the next couple of days, but the snow should still hold up nicely even without the sun to soften it up.&nbsp;</p><p>And although it's only Monday, it's not too early to plan your weekend. This Friday and Saturday marks the final weekend of <a href="/winter-activities/night-skiing" title="Twilight Skiing">Twilight Skiing</a>, so if you want some after-hours turns, this is your last chance. We've also got the first of our <a href="/river-guide" title="Spring Concert Series">spring concert series</a> kicking off this Saturday, March 25.&nbsp;</p><p>We hope you can get yourself and a few buddies up to the mountains soon to enjoy great skiing, and plenty of open terrain. Planning on getting a season pass next year?&nbsp; Want to take advantage of all the snow we currently have? All <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/season-passes">2023-2024 season passes</a> purchased this spring are eligible for use this season starting today March 20th!&nbsp;</p><p>See you out there!<br />-Team Snow</p><p>Friendly Reminder:<br />We love that our guests are exploring new terrain while enjoying the beautiful views and spectacular homes on Merrill Hill and The Glades. With that in mind, we ask that all guests be respectful of the private property directly adjacent to groomed surfaces by avoiding venturing off trail and staying within the boundary lines of the resort.
