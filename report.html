<h5>January 31, 2022</h5><p>Over 700 acres of open terrain await your skis! After 12-14" of powder, groomers took to the slopes to make sure we have ample stripes to ski on 80 of our open trails today. What better way to start your Monday, then by carving into beautiful corduroy terrain after all this snow? We are beginning the day with more than 100 open trail options for you to choose. Catch first chair corduroy at 9AM and ski until 3:45PM. The weather is perfect for a full day of skiing, so come carve into the start of your week!</p><p>Please note that ski-in access to the Jordan Hotel requires the navigation of intermediate trails to reach Jordan Bowl.</p><p><strong>Around the Resort</strong><o:p></o:p><a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/wicked-air-and-apres"></a></p><p>For the latest updates on available shopping, dining, and activities whenever you visit us, head to the <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/river-guide" target="_blank" title="river guide" rel="noopener">River Guide</a>.<o:p></o:p></p><p>-Team Snow</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
