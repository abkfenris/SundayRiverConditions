<strong>Thank you for a great season.</strong></p><p>We're now closed for skiing and riding, which includes uphill access. Please be aware that our team will be working on cleaning up the resort, so heavy equipment and machinery will be active on the mountain over the next few weeks. Please note that all resort dining options are currently closed, as is the Jordan Hotel.&nbsp;</p><p>Looking forward, we have a fun summer planned ahead. The <a href="/summer-and-fall-activities/sunday-river-golf-club" title="golf course">Sunday River Golf Club</a> is scheduled to open on May 14. Tee times for the entire season are available and the earlier you book, the more you'll save. We'll also be open for scenic lift rides, which are always free for 2021-22 passholders, plus the local mountain bike trails, endless hikes, and iconic swimming holes will keep us busy all summer long. Stay tuned for more warm-weather fun.</p><p>Team Snow</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
