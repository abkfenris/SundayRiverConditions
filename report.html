Afternoon Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: December 23, 2023 </strong></em><strong>| 1:23 PM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>Today we had skiing and riding on 20 trails serviced by 4 lifts. We had over 115 acres of open terrain, corduroy on half of it, and new snow on the other half. We hope everyone had as much fun out there today as we did. It&rsquo;s great to be back.</p><p>Our snowmaking team ran guns throughout the day today, and they&rsquo;ll continue making snow tonight. Our grooming team will be out and at it, and tomorrow we can expect groomed terrain on all scheduled trails. Our Mountain Ops team will also continue assessing South Ridge and Jordan in preparation for reopening terrain.</p><p>Tomorrow and into this week, we&rsquo;ll be offering trail-accessible dining at the Barker Food Court and the Barker Bar. Although we aren&rsquo;t currently skiing or riding out of South Ridge, the South Ridge Food Court, Foggy Goggle, and the Coffee Hound will all be open. Don&rsquo;t forget to swing by the Foggy Goggle tonight for the Ugly Sweater Party from 3-6PM, with live music from Hello Newman, and be sure to stay for the fireworks afterward.

We wouldn&rsquo;t be here without everyone who helped.</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
