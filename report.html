<h4><strong>February 5, 2023 | 1:30 PM</strong></h4><h4><strong style="font-size: 2em;">Afternoon Report</strong></h4><p>Fast groomers and calm winds were just what we were hoping for today. The weather, although cold, felt normal again after the last few days we have had. Skiers and riders were bundled up, ready to take advantage of the open lifts and vast open terrain. Our crew created an excellent riding surface last night and even built a new terrain park underneath the South Ridge Quad on Who-ville.</p><p>Tonight snow guns will turn back on in a few areas filling in some areas and preparing closed trails for the upcoming weeks. Groomers will hit the resort tonight, smoothing out our mid-week terrain and getting that ready for another fantastic week ahead.</p><p>This week looks pretty mild for the most part, as temps will range in the 20s to 30s again. Clouds will come and go each day, and a chance for snowfall later in the week is possible. With the weather being fairly unpredictable recently, it's hard to know exactly how this week will go. So far, temps and winds look promising for some great skiing and riding here in Western Maine. We hope you made the most of the cold weekend and are looking forward to some skiing and riding soon here at Sunday River.</p><p>&nbsp;See you next time!<br />-Team Snow</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
