Afternoon Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: January 13, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 1:31 PM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>Today brought 5-6" of snowfall to our mountain, and we couldn't be happier. The winds were lower than predicted, the snow fell longer than we thought it would, and by mid-morning, we had 526 acres of open terrain. Today was a great day.</p><p>Tonight, our snowmaking team will be hitting some key areas on this side of the mountain, as well as further west. We're hoping to open terrain on Merill Hill within the next few days. Our grooming team will be laying stripes on a similar list of trails as last night, with the potential addition of Merrill Hill. Stay tuned for new terrain in the coming days.&nbsp;</p><p>This weekend is <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/mlk-weekend" title="MLK Weekend | Sunday River, Maine">Martin Luther King Jr. Weekend</a>, and we have events lined up for the whole family.
