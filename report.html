<h4><strong>December 18, 2022 | 6:35 AM</strong></h4><p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> <strong>Barker will have a late opening</strong></p><h2><strong>Morning Update</strong></h2><p><strong>Winter has arrived!</strong></p><p>To think, a few days ago, the only snow was on open trails, and the drive up was just grass along the road. Now snow banks pile high, and everywhere is coated with a beautiful blanket of white. The last few days have made all the difference, and it's finally feeling like winter.</p><p>The power is back here in Newry, and we will be able to run ten lifts from White Cap to South Ridge. The Mountain Ops team got out last night to groom heavily skied-off areas throughout the hill and inspect the rest of the terrain after the storm. After scanning the resort, they dropped the ropes and opened Tempest, Wildfire, Escapade, and a few others around the mountain.</p><p>During the day, temperatures will stay below freezing at the base with little temperature difference up top. It was a quiet and calm drive this morning, and the winds should remain like that throughout the day. The tail end of the storm is still passing by, bringing clouds and a casual flurry here or there. It's looking like another classic east coast winter day full of fresh groomers and soft snow.</p><p>&nbsp;We will see you out there!<br />-Team Snow</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
