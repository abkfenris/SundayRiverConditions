Morning Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: December 6, 2023 </strong></em><strong>| 7:40 AM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>Good morning folks, and welcome to Wednesday on the mountain. It's shaping up to be an incredible day out on the slopes. Temps overnight dropped into the single digits, giving our snowmakers the perfect window to turn it up to 11. The cold temps will last into the weekend, and we'll be taking advantage of every second of it.&nbsp;</p><p>The grooming team made the rounds last night, pressing fresh corduroy into every trail, with the exception of Borealis. The cold temps overnight combined with the fresh snow from earlier this week will make for true hero snow, so grab your carving skis and get out there.</p><p>Looking ahead, Saturday is the grand opening of the Barker 6. Celebrations kick off at 8:45AM, with the first chair heading uphill at 9AM. <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/donny-day" title="Donny Day | Sunday River">Donny Pelletier</a> will be in town, and rumor has it will be lapping the new chair looking for people better than him.
