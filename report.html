<h4><strong>January 20, 2023 | 7:30 AM</strong></h4><h2><strong>Morning Report</strong><span></span></h2><p>It's always a magical feeling to wake up and see a fresh blanket of snow outside in the morning. We received a light, fluffy coat of 8 inches of snow here in the heart of western Maine. With more snow forecasted until the end of the day, our team is excited to get out there and explore the terrain with you.</p><p>The Mountain Ops team got to it early after last chair yesterday to groom out as much of the mountain as possible before the storm began late last night. We took advantage of these cold temps and added to the fresh snow with over 150 snow guns running on closed trails. This active snowmaking will continue into today on trails such as 3D, Salvation, White Heat, and Rocking Chair.</p><p>This morning our team will groom out lanes on beginner terrain to provide an easier way down from our 13 scheduled lifts. Keep an eye on the <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/mountain-report">Mountain Report</a> as ski patrol hits the slopes to inspect closed terrain, prepare to drop ropes, and open up fresh runs for the weekend.</p><p>We are set up for a fantastic day as snow continues to fall, temperatures range in the high 20s, and winds remain calm. These ideal conditions will provide an amazing day and weekend of skiing and riding here at Sunday River.</p><p>See you in the freshies!<br />-Team Snow</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
