<p><strong>April 3, 2022</strong></p><p>A beautiful sunrise lights up the peaks this morning. Groomers added a great corduroy base to more than 60 trails for you to ski at 8AM first chair. Temperatures are forecasted to warm into this afternoon so you can take soft turns on nearly 400 acres of open terrain. We are looking forward to more spring skiing today, followed by a chance of light refreshing flurries overnight. Looking ahead, the new week brings more warm afternoons with cooler nights to keep those snow stashes on the slopes.
