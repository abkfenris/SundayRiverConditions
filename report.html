Operations Update</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: December 20, 2023 </strong></em><strong>| 12:45 PM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>We want to express our gratitude to the entire Sunday River community &ndash; from the dedicated team members to the passionate skiers and snowboarders who call this mountain home. Your unwavering support and understanding as we work toward reopening have been a testament to the strength of our tight-knit community.</p><p>Monday&rsquo;s storm certainly left its mark on our beloved mountain. We experienced some damage to infrastructure, including impacts to roadways and trails, as well as localized flooding.</p><p>Recovery efforts have been swift and collaborative. Our dedicated team of mountain operations staff, with the support of local contractors, are working tirelessly to clear debris and repair damages.</p><p>Crews have completed the installation of a temporary bridge at the Grand Summit, and are hard at work repairing road washouts, replacing culverts, and removing debris from base areas.</p><p>While tremendous progress has been made, active construction is ongoing across the resort, and we ask guests and the public to stay off the mountain and not explore any washed-out areas. In addition, all trails, including uphill access, are currently closed.</p><p>Looking ahead, our current plan is to re-open this Saturday, December 23, with limited terrain off of the Barker 6, Locke Triple, Spruce Triple, the South Ridge Express, and the carpets. &nbsp;Any guests with tickets, rentals and lessons booked through Friday, December 22, will be refunded automatically within 7-10 days.&nbsp;</p><p>Access will be limited to season passholders, ticket pack holders, Ikon passholders, and guests who have already purchased lift tickets. Guests who have booked lodging directly through the resort in the Grand Summit,&nbsp; Jordan or Snow Cap Inn&nbsp; may purchase Stay &amp; Save lift tickets for their stay. We will continue to update the Mountain Report with the latest information.</p><p>While we are excited to welcome guests back to the slopes, please note that Bethel and the surrounding area is still recovering from the storm. Limited services will be available both in town and on the mountain. Please plan accordingly.</p><p><span>Thank you and we&rsquo;ll get through this together.</span></p><p>- Team Snow</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
