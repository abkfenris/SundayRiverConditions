Afternoon Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: March 13, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 2:51 PM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>Boy oh boy is it an amazing day. The sun is shining, the snow is soft, and thanks to this last snowstorm, we were able to open over 150 acres of mostly natural terrain today. Those goggle tans should be coming along nicely. Need a little extra time in the sun? Check out any of our slopeside decks for some apr&egrave;s.&nbsp;</p><p>Our grooming team will lay some stripes on 72 trails tonight, and they're planning on giving us the same lineup as today. All of our green terrain and most of our blue terrain will have Corydory tomorrow, as well as some of our advanced and expert terrain like White Heat and Obsession. Tomorrow, check out some glades like Blind Ambition and Last Tango for some tree-filled fun.&nbsp;</p><p>Be sure to check out our <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events" title="Events | Sunday River, Maine">events calendar</a> for a full list of events across the mountain.
