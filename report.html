Morning Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: April 27, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 6:35 AM</strong></h5><p>Well, we certainly have a beautiful day on tap for our last Saturday of the season. We're starting the day with 14 trails and over 100 acres of terrain, with more trails expected to open as temps rise. High's today are forecasted to get into the 60's, and with sunshine on tap all day, you won't want to miss this perfect spring day.</p><p>The Jordan 8 will spin from 8AM-4PM both today and tomorrow. Rogue Angel will be an ungroomed trail for the rest of the weekend and may have a slight delay this morning as temps rise from below-freezing this morning. Please note, spring conditions exist and trail conditions will change throughout the day. There is also no beginner terrain available.</p><p>As we look ahead, Sping Sale rates on <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/season-passes">2024-25&nbsp; New England Passes </a>are still available until April 30.
