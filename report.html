Morning Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: January 13, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 6:54 AM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>Well, folks, it's a blustery one out there. We've got some high winds up top that may impact operations, so be sure to check back here for the most updated lift status. The good news: we've had an inch of snow come down so far, and we expect more to accumulate throughout the morning.&nbsp;</p><p>Our grooming team laid fresh stripes down on most of our open terrain, and we're expecting some delightful turns out there today. Upper Airglow and the lower section of Downdraft join our list of groomed terrain today. Who Ville opened yesterday with 14 jibs and three jumps for a total of 17 features. Need something a little smaller? Head to Wonderland in South Ridge, opening today, for four snow features and two smaller jumps. Our snowmaking team was out last night as well, focusing on Merrill Hill and T72. Ridge Run will remain closed today for snowmaking and maintenance.&nbsp;</p><p>This weekend is <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/mlk-weekend" title="MLK Weekend | Sunday River, Maine">Martin Luther King Jr. Weekend</a>, and we have fun for the whole family.
