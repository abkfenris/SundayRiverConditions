<h4><strong>January 6, 2023 | 2:00 PM</strong></h4><h2><strong>Afternoon Update</strong><span></span></h2><p>Good afternoon, it's almost the weekend, and we are excited for the next few days ahead. Snow has been falling steadily throughout the day, adding a nice layer on top of the freshly groomed trails. Snowmakers will move to closed terrain for the night to expand and provide more trails to ski and ride on soon. If temps allow, snowmakers will remain on until early morning. Snow showers should slow down by early evening, allowing plenty of time for the groomers to get out onto the hill, starting on trails that had snowmaking on last night to push piles and smooth out the surface. The team will tackle the rest of the mountain overnight to groom out this fresh layer of snow and lay down the perfect Sunday River stripes we all look for.</p><p>It looks to be another mild day tomorrow with temps staying around freezing and the sun peaking through moving cloud coverage throughout the day.</p><p>Tomorrow is <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/indie-demo-day">Indie Demo day</a>.
