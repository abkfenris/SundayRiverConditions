</h6><p style="color: #696969; font-weight: 900; font-size: 12px;">SUNDAY, JANUARY 31</p><div><p>What a day. It was a gorgeous Sunday with nothing but blue sky, sunshine, and amazing snow on all eight peaks. It is pure hero snow out there today, dry, squeaky, and carves like a dream.&nbsp;The mountain has been sitting pretty this weekend with over 720 open acres. Ropes have been dropping on our favorite glades and the morning corduroy has been pristine. January is signing off with success, but February is looking to level up. We currently have our eyes on a<strong>&nbsp;</strong>mid-week storm heading our way that could potentially<strong> drop over a foot of snow.&nbsp;</strong>If everything plays out as we hope, this might just be the biggest storm of the year. Start thinking of excuses now, because when this storm hits the only place you will want to be is at the mountain.&nbsp;</p><p><span>This winter, your car is your base lodge. We're here to help you make the most of it by</span><a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/gear-up-giveaway"> giving away over $1,000 in gear from YETI </a><span>to help you boot up in the morning, grab a quick lunch between laps, and kick back for apr&egrave;s. <strong>Enter by February 1 for your chance to win.</strong></span></p><p><span>There are plenty of food options around the resort for spreading out, but please remember that capacity is limited.
