Springfest Sunday has arrived, and the party keeps going. Our groomers could only get onto the hill early this morning due to the high temperatures overnight. They are finishing their grooming plan as the sun rises over the distant mountains. Snow conditions will be firm but perfectly smooth to start the day.</p><p>We are still seeing high winds in our area for the morning. Gusts are forecasted to be as high as 50 mph. As lifts begin to spin this morning, we will be doing constant wind checks at our peaks. Please check the mountain report as you make your way up today, as we do expect some windholds for the morning. We will update our lift status and mountain report as soon as we are notified of any holds. There will also be no uphill access today.</p><p>After a day of lapping our 8 peaks head down to white cap for another afternoon at <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/spring-fest-weekend.xml">Springfest</a>!
