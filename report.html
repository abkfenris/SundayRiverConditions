<h4><strong>January 23, 2023 | 1:23 PM</strong></h4><h2><strong>Afternoon Report</strong><span></span></h2><p>WHEW! Today just got better and better! We had those fat, fluffy flakes falling through the whole morning and another 2" fell between opening and noon today. No complaints from us.&nbsp;</p><p>Looking to tomorrow, we've got some wind coming in, so keep an eye on tomorrow's Mountain Report for updates on operations. It is forecasted to die down by the morning, but we won't know until then. Another item of note: White Heat will not be open tomorrow. Our grooming team is begining the process of pushing out the snowmaking piles, and then laying down some sweet cord. This process takes a couple of days, so White Heat will remain closed until that is completed. But fear not! We still have<strong> over 700 acres</strong> of skiing, so there's plenty of fun for everyone across all 8 peaks.</p><p>&nbsp;See you out there!<br />-Team Snow</p><p>&nbsp;</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
