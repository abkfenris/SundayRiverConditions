<h4><strong>February 14, 2023 | 7:25 AM</strong></h4><h4><strong style="font-size: 2em;">Morning Report</strong></h4><p>Happy Valentine's Day, and welcome to Tuesday on the mountain. Mother Nature was feeling festive overnight and dropped a light coating of mood flakes to celebrate the day. It's nothing to write home about, but the trees have a layer of white, and snow falling is always a welcome site.</p><p>Snowmaking continued to tackle the hill but came off line early as the temps camp above an acceptable range. Grooming also had a big night, tackling 83 trails, and pushing out and laying stripes on 3D. With temps continuing to rise to comfortable temps throughout the day, it's looking like a tremendous day to be on the slopes.&nbsp;</p><p>Please note, there is some wind to be aware of this morning. It has not affected any lift operations at this point, but keep an eye here for any and all updates as they come in throughout the day.</p><p>We'll see you out there!</p><p>-Team Snow</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
