<h5>January 4, 2022</h5><p>The sun is staying this afternoon to light up the slopes! We have the most skiing options in the East, with 69 open trails to shred. Tomorrow we will have nearly 400 acres of corduroy to carve. Snowmakers will be blasting guns all night so you can enjoy freshly made snow in the morning. Lifts are spinning until 3:45PM today for some afternoon runs, or catch first chair tomorrow at 9:00AM.&nbsp;The forecast of flurries is in our future this Friday, so stay tuned as we gear up for a great week!</p><p>Both hotels are now ski-in/ski-out for your convenience. Please note when skiing into both hotels, navigating blue or more advanced terrain is required. At this time, there are no green trails accessible when skiing into the Grand Summit Hotel. When skiing into the Jordan Hotel, beginner terrain is limited to Jordan Peak via Lollapalooza, and skiing in from a different peak is currently considered advanced.</p><p><strong>Around the Resort</strong><o:p></o:p></p><p><a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/special-deals.xml" title="Dash Deals at Sunday River">Dash Deals</a> have hit the slopes this week!
