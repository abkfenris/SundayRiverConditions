The weekend is coming to an end, but keep on enjoying these last few hours on the mountain and soak up that sun. If you don't have to work tomorrow then you're in luck, because it's going to be another stellar day on the slopes. Lifts will start spinning at 9AM all week long. The past few days snowmakers spent time resurfacing trails like American Express, Risky Business, Ecstasy, Right Stuff, and Sunday Punch. Tonight, groomers are going to head out once the sun goes down to press out perfect corduroy for more carving tomorrow.&nbsp;</p><p>If you get hungry while on the slopes we have multiple indoor and outdoor&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/river-guide" style="font-style: inherit;"><strong>dining options</strong></a><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">&nbsp;available this winter, including the ability to order online for select venues</span><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">.</span><span><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p><span>The <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/season-passes" title="Season Passes">2021-22 New England Pass is back on sale</a>, granting access to Sunday River, Loon &amp; Sugarloaf all next year.
