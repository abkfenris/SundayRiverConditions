<h5>December 19, 2021</h5><ul></ul><p>Overnight we had 6-10" accumulate on the trails, creating a fantastic powder day ahead of us. An abundance of options with the most open terrain in the East, we have almost 50 trails and 300 acres filled with fresh snow. This morning groomers are putting down corduroy on South Ridge and North Peak terrain for you to carve. Jordan Bowl opened this weekend along with Kansas, Cyclone, State Fair, and Lollapalooza. What better way to spend a Sunday, than by skiing snowy slopes!</p><p>Since Jordan Bowl is open, both hotels are now ski-in/ski-out access for your convenience. Please note our only beginner terrain is available within the South Ridge Express Quad at this time. With this in mind, skiing into the Grand Summit Hotel is currently accessible via blue terrain. At this time, we are sold out of snowboards at our rental shop for the duration of this weekend. A day full of snow awaits you!</p><p><strong>Around the Resort</strong></p><p>Recently opened for the season, Sliders Restaurant is conveniently located off Lollapalooza and inside the Jordan Hotel. The Mountain Room has also opened, located within Peak Lodge. For retail needs head over to Sunday River Sports, Betty's Treats and Treasures, or unwind at the Jordan Spa.</p><p>For the latest updates whenever you visit us, head to the <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/river-guide">River Guide</a>.</p><p>-Team Snow</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
