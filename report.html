T72 will also make its park debut tomorrow with a few features.</strong> Groomers will head out tonight on normal routes, adding in the new terrain for tomorrow. Hop on first chair at 8AM to enjoy the freshly groomed trails and sunny skies.</p><p>Looking ahead, we're pushing to add even more terrain for the three-day Martin Luther King Jr. weekend and offering <a href="/special-deals/mlk-lodging" title="MLK lodging sale">20% off resort lodging</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">Lifts will tomorrow at 8AM.

This includes day, half-day, beginner, Threedom additional days, and Passholder Friend tickets. We only expect these limits to come into play on peak dates, but encourage everyone to buy early to ensure access on the dates you want. Season passes, Ikon passes, and lift ticket packs remain direct-to-lift with no restrictions or reservations.</p><p>Lastly, please remember to check our <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/covid">COVID Winter Guide</a> before each visit to make a plan for your day and stay on top of any potential changes.
