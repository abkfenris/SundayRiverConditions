Morning Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: February 12, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 7:22 AM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>We hope everyone had a great Superbowl Sunday yesterday, and any 49ers fans out there are able to Shake it Off after a very competitive game. Anyway, let's talk about skiing.</p><p>Due to the warm/freeze cycle we find ourselves in, natural terrain will start the day closed and will likely stay that way through the day. If zones get enough sun and begin to loosen up, patrol will start to reopen terrain, but the majority will begin the day closed. As for the groomed terrain, temps were fortunately cold enough overnight to help out the grooming team and let the snow really set up. It might get a little sugary and sticky into the afternoon, but should still ski pretty nicely.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/presidents-week" title="Presidents' Week | Sunday River, Maine">Presidents' Week</a> is right around the corner, and we have events planned for the whole family.
