Afternoon Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: January 6, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 1:59 PM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>It was a beautiful day out there today, with cold temps and firm snow.&nbsp; Easy Street opened later this morning, making for 283 acres over 45 trails. New terrain will be coming soon. Keep those fingers crossed- the system moving in tonight has shifted, putting us more solidly in the 3-6" range.&nbsp;</p><p>Tonight, our snowmaking team will continue resurfacing open terrain as well as expanding into new terrain. Be sure to check back here tomorrow morning for any updates on snowmaking on open terrain. Our grooming team will be hitting most of our open terrain tonight, with the addition of Double Dipper. Lower Lazy River will likely remain ungroomed, as well as Risky Business and Mixing Bowl.&nbsp;</p><p>There's live music all around the mountain this afternoon and tonight, so stop in for some apr&egrave;s. Mitch Alden is playing at the Barker Bar from 2-5PM, Shut Down Brown is playing at the Foggy Goggle from 3-6PM, and Tickle will be at Shipyard from 7-10PM.
