<h5>January 6, 2022</h5><p>This morning was groomed to perfection, with nearly 400 acres of corduroy to carve! Snowmakers are blasting guns across the mountain tonight in the name of terrain expansion. Groomers are putting down stripes on over 60 trails for first chair tomorrow morning. Let the flurries fly in Friday as the forecast calls for 1-3" of accumulation slopeside. Grab your gear and shred some fresh snow this weekend! Both hotels are now ski-in/ski-out for your convenience. When skiing into the Jordan Hotel, beginner terrain is limited to Jordan Peak via Lollapalooza, and skiing in from a different peak requires navigation of intermediate trails. Lifts are spinning from 9:00AM until 6:30PM tomorrow for <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/winter-activities/night-skiing.xml" title="Twilight Skiing">Twilight Skiing</a>!
