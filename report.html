Continue to check lift status for updates.&nbsp;</p><p>We're waking up to a classic Maine spring morning with some wet weather rolling through. Our groomers hit the slopes overnight to press stripes on about 50 trails, as they switch to a more limited grooming plan to preserve snow. If you're heading out there today, expect softening snow throughout the day with groomed surfaces in the morning turning to bumps by the afternoon. Looking ahead, we have sunshine returning tomorrow for an awesome Saturday on the slopes. If your legs aren&rsquo;t feeling it yet, then you either haven&rsquo;t been here enough this week or you&rsquo;re not skiing enough bumps.&nbsp;</p><p>Please note that the South Ridge takeout window will be closed today, head over to our <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/river-guide" target="_blank" rel="noopener">River Guide</a> for more dining options.&nbsp;</p><div><p>With operations open daily through April 24, there is plenty of ski season ahead.
