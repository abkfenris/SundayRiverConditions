<h4><strong>March 18, 2023 |1:30 PM</strong><strong></strong></h4><h4><strong style="font-size: 2em;">Afternoon Report</strong></h4><p>Today was an absolutely gorgeous day here in the heart of western Maine. The sun shone brightly, and by the first chair, there was not a cloud in the sky. Temps were comfortable, and the snow surface quickly began to soften up. By midday, snow was soft, carved with ease up top, and became creamy mashed potatoes at the base. Conditions held up well as groomed trails remained smooth for the most part, and only heavily trafficked areas became moguled up. The day is not over yet as lifts will spin at South Rdge until 6PM and there are plenty of places on the mountain to enjoy such a wonderful afternoon even if your boots are already off.&nbsp;</p><p>Our team will be back on the hill overnight to groom in those Sunday River stripes and prepare the mountain for another day. Sunday will bring slightly colder temps, partially cloudy skies, and calm winds. There is still plenty of snow out there as we plan to start the morning with all lifts spinning and the majority of our trails still open.</p><p>We hope you can get yourself and a few buddies up to the mountains this weekend to enjoy comfortable temps, great skiing, and plenty of open terrain. Planning on getting a season pass next year?&nbsp; Want to take advantage of all the snow we currently have? All <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/season-passes">2023-2024 season passes</a> purchased this spring are eligible for use this season starting March 20th!&nbsp;</p><p>Let's have a weekend!<br />-Team Snow</p><p>Friendly Reminder:<br />We love that our guests are exploring new terrain while enjoying the beautiful views and spectacular homes on Merrill Hill and The Glades. With that in mind, we ask that all guests be respectful of the private property directly adjacent to groomed surfaces by avoiding venturing off trail and staying within the boundary lines of the resort.
