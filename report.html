Morning Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: December 26, 2023 </strong></em><strong>| 6:47 AM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>Today looks like a great day, folks. Temperatures will warm up to the mid-forties, the sun might peak out from behind the clouds, and South Ridge reopens today. We have over 165 acres of skiable terrain scheduled, serviced by 8 lifts. The South Ridge Express is scheduled for 10AM, and the Sundance Surface Lifts are scheduled for 8AM. All of our open beginner terrain will be at South Ridge today. All other open trails are advanced terrain.</p><p>We&rsquo;ll be able to access South Ridge from Barker via Outta Here, and we&rsquo;ll be able to travel to Barker from South Ridge via Lower Lazy River. We will have crossing guards at these junctions to allow construction to continue. Please note that only the lower section of Lower Lazy River will be open. It will not be open from the top of the South Ridge Express. &nbsp;</p><p>We have exciting events happening this week, including <span><a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/fireworks">fireworks</a></span>, dinner with <span><a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/winter-activities/eddy-and-betty-the-yetis">Eddy and Betty</a></span>, and more.

We wouldn&rsquo;t be here without everyone who helped.</p><p>We'll see you out there!</p><p>- Team Snow</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
