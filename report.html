Morning Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: February 18, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 6:25 AM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>Goooooood morning and happy Presidents' Day! We're starting the day with 18 lifts scheduled to spin and over 100 trails to explore. Oz quad will not open today due to trail conditions in that zone. We are also experiencing some strong wind gusts that could affect lift operations. Keep an eye out here for updates as we receive them. Other than that, we got a nice dusting of snow overnight; only about an inch at the base, but it's accumulation we'll happily take.&nbsp;</p><p>Grooming took to the slopes last night and got to their normal list of trails, and adding in Lower Vortex to the mix of groomed terrain. Natural terrain is still skiing on the wild side, so if you're looking for predictably good conditions, the groomers won't disappoint.</p><p><a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/presidents-week" title="Presidents' Week | Sunday River, Maine">Presidents' Week</a> is here, and we have a whole host of events.
