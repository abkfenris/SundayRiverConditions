Morning Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: January 8, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 7:23 AM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>Good morning everyone, we've got a spectacular day coming at you. If you missed yesterday's snow, don't sweat it because today's going to be pretty mint too. Grooming took to the hill to work in the 7" of new snow we got yesterday, which will make for an incredible surface today. Temps are hovering around the high teens down low with a bit of a breeze, so make sure you layer accordingly. We are getting some pretty good gusts up high on the mountain, so we may have some lifts start the day on hold until the wind dies down a bit.</p><p>After assessing the trail conditions, patrol has made the decision that Escapade will not open today. To make up for that, rumor has it that Tempest might be opening today. Patrol needs to take a look at it this morning so don't count on it for your first 9AM lap, but if patrol gives it the green light, it should come online early this morning.</p><p><a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/special-deals/dash-deals-sale" title="Dash Deals | Sunday River, Maine">Dash Deals</a> will be online for only a few more days.
