The clouds are rolling in this afternoon as Mother Nature brews up a storm on the horizon. If this storm plays out as we hope, we could see <strong>well over a foot of snow these next few days.</strong> Start thinking of excuses now, because when this storm hits, this is the only place you will want to be.</p><p>Take advantage of our mid-week deal with<a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/booklodging?Checkin=2021-2-1&amp;Checkout=&amp;Adults=2&amp;Children=0&amp;Others=0#/room.xml"> 20% off resort lodging</a>. Stay slopeside so you can hop on first chair and enjoy shredding all day.

Come to the mountain early and be ready to indulge in free refills all day. Rest those legs tonight, because this is going to be an awesome week. Please note that the cabins will remain off of the Chondola until this storm passes.</p><p><span>We are&nbsp;</span><a title="Online Store" href="https://shop.sundayriver.com/s/lift-tickets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>requiring online lift ticket purchase</strong></a><span>&nbsp;and setting </span><strong>limits on the number of tickets</strong><span>&nbsp;sold for each day. This includes full-day, half-day, beginner, Threedom additional days, and Passholder Friend tickets.
