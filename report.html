<h4><strong>December 21, 2022 | 7:40 AM</strong></h4><h2><strong>Morning Update</strong></h2><p>Good morning skiers and riders, and happy Wednesday! Today I bring great news! Our team worked through the night to prepare the Aurora Peak Quad and surrounding terrain for an additional peak opening today. Aurora Peak is scheduled to open today, including trails such as Northern Lights, Borealis, Aludra, Lights Out, and possibly even Paradigm. The Snowcats gave the rest of the open terrain a once-over last night, and active snowmaking will be present in a few areas around the resort. Our parks crew has been adding features to their Wonderland park, running five jibs and two snow features.&nbsp;</p><p>It's looking like another wintery day here in western Maine, with temps varying within the 20s and mild wind speeds throughout the day. A lot is going on here at Sunday River as we push our team to open more terrain and lifts for the season. If you plan on spending the holidays at your happy place, check out all the events and activities around the resort as we kick off the <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/christmas-vacation-weeks">holiday season.</a></p><p>We will see you out there!<br />-Team Snow</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
