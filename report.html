<h4><strong>January 8, 2023 | 1:00 PM</strong></h4><h2><strong>Afternoon Update</strong><span></span></h2><p>Sunday brought blue skies and sun to Sunday River. It was cold enough to keep the snow guns on throughout the day, and trails remained firm enough not to become skied off and filled with moguls. Temps were steady around 30 all day and will dip below 20 overnight. Our team will get out there to turn on the snow guns all over the resort. The snow cats will hit the slopes to groom as many trails as they can get to if not all of them.</p><p>It looks like another week of colder temps is ahead, perfect for making more snow to grow our open terrain and bring the best skiing we can to western Maine. Keep an eye on the mountain report for lift and trail status changes as we push to open more trails soon.</p><p>Tomorrow is the start of <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/kids-week">Kid's week</a> here at Sunday River.
