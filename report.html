<p><strong>February 5, 2022</strong></p><p>Today&rsquo;s bluebird is brought to you by 18&rdquo; of new snow and sunshine across 8 peaks! Choose from any trail, since 100% of our terrain is now open. Over the last week we have received nearly 3 feet of snow, making our 135 glades and trails absolutely stunning for you to ski this weekend. Oz Quad is spinning for a total of 17 lifts to bring you up the slopes today. Navigate all-natural terrain this afternoon on Vortex, Airglow, 3D, and White Heat, or carve their fresh corduroy tomorrow morning. South Paw and Black Hole will be left ungroomed tomorrow as well as this afternoon, for you to enjoy those snow stashes.</p><p>Prefer to take your turns in the trees? Enjoy any of our glades, or try out our <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/boundary-to-boundary">boundary-to-boundary skiing</a>, consisting of nearly 2,000 acres for you to explore. Take as many trails as you can this afternoon, then come to North Peak for <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/winter-activities/night-skiing.xml"><strong>Twilight Skiing</strong></a> from 4-6:30PM tonight. Since the snowy system is leaving town, please keep an eye on the lift and trail status throughout the afternoon as we may experience some winds. Catch 8AM first chair tomorrow morning to ski heaps of snow at your happy place!</p><p><strong>Around the Resort</strong></p><p>OutRyders is partnering with Sunday River to bring you <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/pride-weekend.xml" title="event listing">Pride Weekend</a> going on now.
