</h6><p style="color: #696969; font-weight: 900; font-size: 12px;">THURSDAY, JANUARY 21</p><p>Drink your coffee and hit the slopes because it is time for some Thursday turns. Last night the groomers spread out across the mountain to tackle each peak and press out perfect stripes. Mother Nature gave us a nice little refresh yesterday with a couple of inches of powdery snow now groomed into the slopes. Grab first chair at 9AM to carve your way through the corduroy. Snowmakers are taking advantage of these cooler temps and have snow guns fired up on Shockwave, Roadrunner, Rocking Chair, and a few guns on Starlight and Lower Mixing Bowl.</p><p>Please note that our lift mechanics team is tackling a mechanical issue this morning on the Jordan Bowl Express, which will start the day on hold. The Jordan Mountain Double will be open for hotel guests to ski-out. Keep an eye on lift status this afternoon for updates on the Jordan Bowl Express.</p><p style="font-style: inherit;">Dreaming of a wintery getaway? One-night stays are now available this weekend for the Jordan Hotel and the Snow Cap Inn. We are experiencing high call volume in our call center and recommend using our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/booklodging" style="font-style: inherit;"><strong style="font-style: inherit;">online booking engine</strong></a>&nbsp;for quotes or reservations.&nbsp;</p><p>There are plenty of food options around the resort for spreading out, but please remember that capacity is limited. Take a look at the <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/river-guide">River Guide</a> to discover locations, hours, online ordering, and how to make a reservation. For any needs such as season pass pickup, shopping, tuning, rentals, and SnowSports School, head to South Ridge Lodge.</p><p>This winter we are&nbsp;<a title="Online Store" href="https://shop.sundayriver.com/s/lift-tickets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>requiring online lift ticket purchase</strong></a>&nbsp;and setting <strong>limits on the number of tickets</strong>&nbsp;sold for each day. This includes full-day, half-day, beginner, Threedom additional days, and Passholder Friend tickets. We only expect these limits to affect peak dates, but encourage everyone to buy early to ensure access on the dates you want. Season passes, Ikon passes, and lift ticket packs remain direct-to-lift with no restrictions or reservations.</p><p>Fast and contactless lift ticket pickup is available at our PUBs (Pick Up Boxes) at base lodges and hotels. Just scan the barcode at the bottom of your confirmation email and your RFID cards will print with your lift tickets or ticket packs loaded. For best results turn off dark mode on your phone if you use it and avoid email apps that use dark backgrounds.</p><p>Before each trip to the slopes, make sure you visit our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/covid">COVID Winter Guide</a>&nbsp;to make a plan for your visit and stay on top of any potential changes.&nbsp;</p><p>Tips up!</p><p>- Team Snow</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
