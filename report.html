<h4><strong>February 7, 2023 | 7:35 AM</strong></h4><h4><strong style="font-size: 2em;">Morning Report</strong></h4><p>Yesterday's corduroy was what dreams are made of. Soft, receptive to an edge, and so reliable you could tackle any trail any way you wanted to. Warm temps were refreshing after the weekend freeze, and everyone on the mountain was having an incredible day. While it won't be as warm today, the snow is expected to be just as incredible.&nbsp;</p><p>The groomers continued their patrols across the mountain, smooth beautiful cord into 75 trails.&nbsp; Our snowmakers are still continuing their efforts across the mountain, running top-to-bottom guns on Top Gun and Shockwave. Please note, the bottom of Sunday Punch between Right Stuff and Tourist Trap will have active snowmaking today.&nbsp;</p><p>It's looking to be an incredible day on the mountain, and we sure hope you can join us for some Tuesday turns.</p><p>&nbsp;See you out there!<br />-Team Snow</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
