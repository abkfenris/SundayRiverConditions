Afternoon Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: February 27, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 2:55 PM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>Today has been a 10/10, no notes. Sunshine has dominated the sky and temps are soaring into the mid-40's making for some delightful soft skiing. If you weren't able to get out there today, you're missing out.&nbsp;</p><p>We're looking at some unsettled weather moving in this evening which will make for an... interesting Wednesday. It's not the weather we hope for this time of year, but we have the base to come out of this in great shape.</p><p>Snowmaking will remain offline while the team continues to assess the forecast and find feasible windows to make more snow. Right now, it's looking like Thursday will be the next viable window for some flakes to fly. In the meantime, rest assured that their early season efforts have paid off, and we have tons of snow to play with on over 750 acres of open terrain.</p><p>For tonight, we'll have our next <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/eddy-and-betty-dinner-feb-27">Eddy &amp; Betty Dinner at South Ridge</a>. Join your favorite yetis for an evening of fun and activities with color stations, a book reading, and a magic show.&nbsp;</p><p>Lastly, it's never a bad time to review the Skier Responsibility Code. Take a moment, refresh yourself before heading out, and please remember to go slow in the base areas.</p><p>We'll see you out there!</p><p>- Team Snow</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
