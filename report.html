With 100% open terrain, plus <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/boundary-to-boundary">boundary-to-boundary access</a>, the possibilities are endless today. Look for ultimate corduroy on over 70 trails, like Risky Business, Dream Maker, and Excalibur. Take on the stashes of newly opened Chutzpah and Northern Exposure. Or check out the soft bumps of Shockwave, Quantum Leap, and Vortex. Whatever you're searching for, you will find it today.&nbsp;</p><p>Looking ahead to the holiday, we have quite the line-up for <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/presidents-week">Presidents' Day Weekend</a> and week.
