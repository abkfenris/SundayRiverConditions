We'll keep this short and sweet this morning.</span></p><p><span class="ui-provider ve b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z ab ac ae af ag ah ai aj ak" dir="ltr">We definitely tried, but Mother Nature has had the final word. All aerial chair lifts will be on wind hold this morning. Our lift operations team is currently working to open the Sundance surface lifts in South Ridge Basin and the Alera Group Competition T-Bar in Barker Basin. At this time, those will be the only lifts servicing terrain. Our teams will keep an eye on all other lifts as winds are forecasted to subside throughout the day, but that is not expected to happen until at least this afternoon. Any updates to our lift status will be reflected here.</span></p><p>North Peak Lodge will be closed for today. This includes restrooms, seating area, Peak Lodge Food Court and The Mountain Room.</p><p><span class="ui-provider ve b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z ab ac ae af ag ah ai aj ak" dir="ltr">As a reminder,&nbsp;<strong>Uphill Access is closed today, as is Night Skiing.</strong></span></p><p><span class="ui-provider ve b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z ab ac ae af ag ah ai aj ak" dir="ltr">Thank you all for your patience and understanding as we work through the challenges this weather presents.</span></p><p><span class="ui-provider ve b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z ab ac ae af ag ah ai aj ak" dir="ltr">Stay warm, and stay safe.</span></p><p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto;">-Team Snow</p><p></p><p></p><p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto;"><span style="color: #0e101a;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
