<h4><strong>April 7, 2023 |&nbsp; 7:15 AM</strong><strong></strong></h4><h4><strong style="font-size: 2em;">Morning Report</strong></h4><p>Good morning Sunday River rippers, we've got the makings of an excellent day lined up. Even with yesterday's underdevoloped snow, we still fared pretty well. Temps never got all that chilly last night, so the morning should start out reasonably soft by spring skiing standards. Natural terrain will be open, but you may still want to give that a bit of time to soften up, but the groomed terrain should be top notch from the get-go.&nbsp;</p><p>The weather has a few things of note today. First being it's going to start warm and gradually cool off throughout the day. It's looking like the low of the day will be approximately mid-20s, which is still plenty warm. The sun will be out with some scattered clouds, but a hearty helping of blue sky to keep working on your goggle tan. The last piece is the wind, which is forecasted to pick up as the day progresses. We'll keep the Mountain Report updated with any lift changes as needed.</p><p>This weekend is looking phenomenal, and we've got a full slate of awesome Spring events coming at you. Pond-A-Palooza and our final Spring Concert of the year are tomorrow, and we've got fun Easter events planned for Sunday, so come and celebrate with family and friends at your happy place.
