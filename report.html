This morning we have a spectacular sunny day on the slopes but Mother Nature has a snowstorm brewing on the horizon. If this storm plays out as we hope, we could see <strong>well over a foot of snow these next few days.</strong> Start thinking of excuses now, because when this storm hits, this is the only place you will want to be.</p><p>Take advantage of our mid-week deal with<a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/booklodging?Checkin=2021-2-1&amp;Checkout=&amp;Adults=2&amp;Children=0&amp;Others=0#/room.xml"> 20% off resort lodging</a>. Stay slopeside so you can hop on first chair and enjoy shredding all day. Our call center is currently experiencing a high call volume, so we suggest using our online booking option. &nbsp;</p><p>Lifts will open at 9AM today. Last night the groomers worked their way across all eight peaks pressing out perfect stripes. With over 720 open acres, there is a lot to enjoy out there. Ropes have been dropping on our favorite glades and once the snow starts tonight they are only going to get better.</p><p><span>This winter, your car is your base lodge.
