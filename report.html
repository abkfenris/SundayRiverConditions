Our groomers went out on their normal routes overnight to press the perfect stripes on over 80 trails for today's turns. Get in some blissful midweek carving and keep an eye out over the next few days as ropes have started to drop on some of our naturals. Over the weekend snowmakers resurfaced trails like American Express, Risky Business, Ecstasy, Right Stuff, and Sunday Punch, so you won&rsquo;t want to miss those. There's a lot to enjoy out there, so hop on first chair at 9AM.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/season-passes" title="Season Passes">2021-22 New England Pass is back on sale</a>, granting access to Sunday River, Loon &amp; Sugarloaf all next year.
