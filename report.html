<h4><strong>January 20, 2023 | 2:15 PM</strong></h4><h2><strong>Afternoon Report</strong><span></span></h2><p>Today was one of those east coast ski days we only get a couple of times a year. We started the morning with over 6" of snow throughout the resort and up to 8" at the top of our peaks. The snow continued to fall as the day went on, adding fresh layers to our snowpack. The ski patrol team was able to drop ropes and open over ten new trails as the day went on. This included the infamous White Heat, one trail many have been waiting to ski and ride all season. Snow was light and fluffy on the ground as it steadily continued to fall throughout the day. We are going into the weekend strong with all this fresh snow covering over 650 Acres of open terrain for you to choose from.</p><p>Our Mountain Ops team is still eager to take advantage of these colder temps this weekend and will keep making snow on terrain all over our eight peaks. The Snowcats will get onto the mountain shortly after last chair tonight to groom and smooth out as many of our trails as they can get to. The overnight grooming will provide soft, smooth, edge-griping corduroy for the morning.</p><p>The forecast says it will be another weekend of mid to high 20 degree temps, low winds, and partially cloudy skies. An excellent combination for smooth trails, fast turns, and even more snowmaking.</p><p>See you out there!<br />-Team Snow</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
