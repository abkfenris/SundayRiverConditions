Our snowmaking team has produced an amazing product, but now it's time for our grooming team to jump in. You can expect to see groomed trails off both Locke and Barker for Sunday morning. Even with the grooming, there is no beginner terrain, so please be mindful of that and enjoy the snow!</p><p>Pre-season conditions will continue to exist as we work on expanding our offerings.
