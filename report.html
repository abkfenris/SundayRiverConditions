<p><strong>December 8, 2022 | 1:55 PM</strong></p><p>Plenty of turns were available today; although the conditions did vary, the mountain ops team did a great job preserving the snowpack and grooming out trails last night. As the clouds passed, letting the sun out in sections, the mountain began to soften up and ski great. The temperatures remain in the 40s and will continue dropping throughout the evening. This will allow our mountain ops team to continue trail expansion towards White Cap Lodge and the Grand Summit Hotel in preparation for opening that area as soon as possible. The team will also be hard at work creating snow throughout other areas of the resort and pushing it around to groom out perfect corduroy for the days ahead.</p><p>Tomorrow's weather looks clear and sunny, with temperatures staying below 40 degrees throughout lift hours. Our Snowsports school officially opens tomorrow, offering skiing, snowboarding, and ski bike lessons for kids and adults.
