Morning Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: March 8, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 7:35 AM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>Blue skies, sunshine, and cooler temps overnight; the only other thing we could ask for is some snow, and luckily, we can make our own. In addition to lovely weather for today, we also have active snowmaking across the resort. With temps rising to the mid-forties, low winds, and 72 groomed trails, it's shaping up to be a great day.&nbsp;</p><p>Our grooming team went back to their regularly scheduled programming last night, and they laid stripes on over 80% of our open terrain. Check out Obsession and Right Stuff for a more challenging carve, or set your sights on Lollapalooza and Excalibur for a more relaxing cruise. Either way, you can't go wrong. Our snowmakers were also on the hill last night, and we currently have active snowmaking on Lazy River, Jungle Road, Upper Sunday Punch, Ecstasy, Cascades, and the Barker Basin. While those trails received an early groom last night, they will have ungroomed snowmaking product on top. Check out the lift and trail status below for the most up-to-date information.&nbsp;</p><p>We have twilight skiing tonight out of South Ridge, so stay late and ski under the lights. Catch James Rice at the Foggy Goggle from 3-6PM tonight, or head over to Shipyard to see Dos Devils from 5-8PM. We have more live music tomorrow, including a live DJ at the Alpeniglu all day. <span>Be sure to check out our <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/apres-and-nightlife" title="Apres and Nightlife | Sunday River, Maine">Apr&egrave;s &amp; Nightlife</a> schedule for a full list of live music across the mountain.
