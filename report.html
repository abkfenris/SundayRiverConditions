<h4><strong>December 20, 2022 | 7:30 PM</strong></h4><h2><strong>Morning Report</strong></h2><p>Happy Tuesday! We're back to your regularly scheduled programming with 9 lifts servicing nearly 400 acres across 6 peaks. The groomers have been having a ball working this weekend's snow into our existing base, and the results speak for themselves. Plentiful corduroy awaits those on their way to the hill today.</p><p>Today is looking beautiful, with temps reaching highs around 32, under mostly sunny skies. There is a slight breeze hanging around this morning, which is forecasted to diminish as the day goes on. We're not expecting any disruptions to our regularly scheduled lifts, but as always, keep an eye here for the most up-to-date information.&nbsp;</p><p>Looking ahead, we're rolling full steam into <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/christmas-vacation-weeks">Christmas Week</a> with enjoyment for the whole family. It's definitely not one to miss.</p><p>We'll see you out there!</p><p>-Team Snow</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
