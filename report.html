</p><p style="color: #696969; font-weight: 900; font-size: 12px;">TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 9</p><div><p>After waking up to a few inches of new snow yesterday, Mother Nature is coming through again today to give us another layer. Conditions have been fantastic out on the slopes and with options of carving up the groomers, bopping through the trees, and mastering the moguls,&nbsp;there's a lot to enjoy out there. Keep it up for the rest of the day as we ski and ride around in a snow globe. Come back tomorrow at 9AM to enjoy the freshly pressed corduroy on over 70 trails and the new snow on the naturals and in the trees.&nbsp;</p><p>Looking ahead to the holiday, we have quite the line-up for <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/presidents-week">Presidents' Day Weekend</a> and week. Keep in mind lift tickets are limited and days are already selling out, so plan ahead if you want to hit the slopes next week. Or <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/booklodging">book lodging</a> with us and guarantee access to full-day lift tickets.&nbsp;</p><p><span>Please note that kids ski school lessons are now available to <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/lessons/kids-lessons" target="_blank" rel="noopener">book online&nbsp;</a>with limited availability.</span></p><p><span>We are&nbsp;</span><a title="Online Store" href="https://shop.sundayriver.com/s/lift-tickets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>requiring online lift ticket purchase</strong></a><span>&nbsp;and setting </span><strong>limits on the number of tickets</strong><span>&nbsp;sold for each day. This includes full-day, half-day, beginner, Threedom additional days, and Passholder Friend tickets. We only expect these limits to affect peak dates, but encourage everyone to buy early to ensure access on the dates you want. Season passes, Ikon passes, and lift ticket packs remain direct-to-lift with no restrictions or reservations.</span></p><p><span>Fast and contactless lift ticket pickup is available at our PUBs (Pick Up Boxes) at base lodges and hotels. Just scan the barcode at the bottom of your confirmation email and your RFID cards will print with your lift tickets or ticket packs loaded. For best results turn off dark mode on your phone if you use it and avoid email apps that use dark backgrounds.</span></p><p><span>Please remember to take a self-administered </span><a title="Health Screening" href="https://www.sundayriver.com/covid">Health Screening</a><span> and visit our&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/covid">COVID Winter Guide</a><span>&nbsp;before each trip to stay up-to-date on safety protocols and state guidelines.</span></p><p>Masks up!</p><p><span>Team Snow</span></p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
