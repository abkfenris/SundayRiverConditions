Morning Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: March 23, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 7:34 AM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>7:35AM Update: 4" and counting.&nbsp;</p><p>It's what we've all been waiting for: a snow day. 2-3" have fallen so far, and it won't stop falling until early tomorrow morning. Forecasts are varied, but we're looking at accumulations over a foot at the very least. The best thing about an all-day snowstorm? Fresh powder, all day. So wax those skis and hit the trail, because today should be a good one.&nbsp;</p><p>Our grooming team took care of 75 trails last night, including Lazy River, Risky Business, Tourist Trap, and Three Mile Trail. The Merrill Hill trails also received a groom last night, and the grooming team is taking care of South Ridge right now to try and work in as much new snow as possible. If you're looking for powder stashes, never fear; there should be plenty throughout the day. Our snowmaking team made snow on Excalibur last night, and those guns came offline early this morning. Excalibur remains ungroomed with snowmaking product on it. Uphill travel also resumes today. As always, check out the lift, trail, and uphill status below for the most up-to-date information.&nbsp;</p><p>Thinking about a season pass for next year? Buy now, ski now has officially started.
