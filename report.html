<h5>January 30, 2022</h5><p>We are enjoying 12-14" of new snow on more than 700 open acres of terrain! After Mother Nature delivered over a foot of snow, groomers put down beautiful corduroy across 8 peaks for us to enjoy. Take your turns on more than 100 trails this afternoon, with lifts spinning until 3:45PM today. Tonight there will be more stripes for first chair at 9AM so that you can carve into the start of your week. <span>As this snowy system moves out of town, please keep in mind the wind will temporarily impact our lifts. We will keep you updated on our lift and trail status as the wind calm into this afternoon.</span>&nbsp;Shred your Sunday away on fresh snow!</p><p>Please note that ski-in access to the Jordan Hotel requires the navigation of intermediate trails to reach Jordan Bowl.</p><p><strong>Around the Resort</strong><o:p></o:p><a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/wicked-air-and-apres"></a></p><p>For the latest updates on available shopping, dining, and activities whenever you visit us, head to the <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/river-guide" target="_blank" title="river guide" rel="noopener">River Guide</a>.<o:p></o:p></p><p>-Team Snow</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
