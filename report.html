Morning Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: December 23, 2023 </strong></em><strong>| 7:54 AM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>Good morning, Sunday River.</p><p>Today we have 17 trails and four lifts. With over 100 acres of advanced skiing and riding&nbsp; terrain, a mix of groomed and ungroomed trails, and temperatures in the upper twenties, today feels like a great day to jump back into it. For some fresh snow from our snowmakers,&nbsp; head over to Cascades, Starlight, Heat's On, and Roadrunner. There is active snowmaking on Sirius and Aludra. Please be aware that there is no open beginner terrain, and ski school remains closed until we are able to reopen South Ridge for skiing.</p><p>Our Mountain Ops team has been working nonstop the past few days, and it shows. Our snow guns have been running since Thursday night, and we&rsquo;ve managed to rebuild all of our previously open terrain on Barker and Spruce. Our grooming team pushed snow everywhere they could, and they&rsquo;ll continue to work their way across the mountain in the next few days.</p><p>This weekend, we&rsquo;ll be offering trail-accessible dining at the Barker Food Court and the Barker Bar. Although we aren&rsquo;t currently skiing or riding out of South Ridge, the South Ridge Food Court, Foggy Goggle, and the Coffee Hound will all be open.&nbsp; Stop by the Foggy Goggle for the Ugly Sweater Party from 3-6PM featuring live music from Hello Newman, and stay for the fireworks show starting at 7pM. Be sure to check out the <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/river-guide" title="River Guide | Sunday River, Maine">River Guide</a> for a full list of open locations and current hours, and remember to check with area restaurants and businesses for updated hours as they work to reopen following the storm.</p><p>We would like to reiterate our heartfelt thank you to everyone who has helped rebuild our mountain, from our team here to local contractors to supporters all over. Many people call Sunday River their happy place, and that shows. We&rsquo;re excited to welcome you back.</p><p><span></span><span></span><span>- Team Snow</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
