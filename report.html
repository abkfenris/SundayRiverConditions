<p><strong>December 13, 2022 | 4:55 PM&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The good times, they keep on rolling. Another day of excellent skiing under the sun, and the early-season legs are starting to gain some strength. Hopefully, you're feeling some strength too, because it's finally looking like snow is on the way. While amounts are still uncertain, all models are aligning on a good dump for the interior of New England. About time. Regardless of the outcome of this weekend's storm, our Mountain Ops crew is charging full steam ahead, taking advantage of this prolonged cold to make as much snow as possible. The groomers will be back at it this evening, resurfacing all open terrain for your enjoyment. Lifts spin at 9 AM, so make your way to Western Maine.</p><p>We've also got some events coming down the pipeline this weekend with <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/winterfest-weekend">Winterfest Weekend</a>, this Saturday, December 17. All in all, this week is shaping up to be a darn good one. We'll see you out there!</p><p>-Team Snow</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
