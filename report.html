<h5>December 20, 2021</h5><p>It's a beautiful day on Sunday River slopes! Our 300 open acres and almost 50 groomed trails are still basking in blue skies so you can catch some runs this afternoon. Tomorrow the resort will be filled with corduroy for you to carve, and snowmakers will be blasting guns so that we can open even more terrain soon. The holidays are looking as bright as the sky today, with forecasts predicting more snow to come on top of the 6-10" we just received.</p><ul></ul><p>Since Jordan Bowl is open, both hotels are now ski-in/ski-out access for your convenience. Please note our only beginner terrain is available within the South Ridge Express Quad at this time. With this in mind, skiing into the Grand Summit Hotel is currently accessible via blue terrain. Rental snowboards are now back in stock. Cheers to days filled with sun, snow, and skiing!</p><p><strong>Around the Resort</strong></p><p>Recently opened for the season, Sliders Restaurant is conveniently located off Lollapalooza and inside the Jordan Hotel. The Mountain Room has also opened, located within Peak Lodge. For retail needs head over to Sunday River Sports, Betty's Treats and Treasures, or unwind at the Jordan Spa.</p><p>For the latest updates whenever you visit us, head to the <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/river-guide">River Guide</a>.</p><p>-Team Snow</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
