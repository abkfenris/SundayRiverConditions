<p><strong>March 8, 2022</strong></p><p>The sun is shining as snowguns blast across the slopes! Please note all uphill access is closed for today. While winds impact lifts this afternoon, please check the lift and trail status for our most updated availability. We couldn't be more excited as temperatures cool, bringing ideal conditions for making snow. Snowmakers are currently adding to Lower Starlight and Lazy River, and will continue to blast guns all night. Our fantastic mountain operations team is working around the clock to provide the best quality and quantity of terrain to take your turns. Groomers are putting down fresh corduroy on more than 80 trails to carve-in at 9AM first chair. As winds calm overnight, we look forward to increasing our terrain access for you tomorrow. Look forward to new corduroy and freshly made flakes!&nbsp;</p><p>At this time, ski-in access to the Jordan Hotel requires navigation of intermediate and advanced terrain.
