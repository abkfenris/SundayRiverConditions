Afternoon Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: January 11, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 1:13 PM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>Today, we had temps in the low to mid-thirties, cloudy skies, and lovely turns. The snow we got yesterday is serving as a great base-building material for our snowmakers and groomers, and the snow in the forecast will be the icing on the cake. Weekend, here we come.&nbsp;</p><p>Our snowmaking team will be turning those snow guns back on this evening, and they'll be working out on Merrill Hill and trails west of that. Our grooming team will be grooming a similar list of trails as the past couple of nights, and they'll also be pushing out those whalebacks on Tempest. Additionally, the Whoville terrain park will open in time for twilight skiing tomorrow afternoon, and we're expecting around 16 features.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/special-deals/dash-deals-sale" title="Dash Deals | Sunday River, Maine">Dash Deals</a> expire tonight at midnight, so be sure to grab up to 20 off of lodging and up to 50% off of lift tickets before then.
