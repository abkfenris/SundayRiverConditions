</p><p style="color: #696969; font-weight: 900; font-size: 12px;">THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 11</p><div><p>There are fresh stripes and sunshine calling you today so don&rsquo;t let it go to voicemail, your mailbox is already full anyway. Hop on first chair at 9AM for another beautiful day on the mountain. Last night the snowcats cruised around the slopes leaving pristine corduroy behind. The glades are still holding the goods too, so don&rsquo;t forget to check out those trails, especially over on Jordan. The snow is dry, squeaky, and carves like a dream and you will definitely be smiling under your mask. It is pure bliss under your boots out there.</p><p style="font-style: inherit;">Starting tomorrow, we have quite the line-up for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/presidents-week">Presidents&rsquo; Week</a> with twilight skiing every night, fireworks, and<a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/valentines-day"> Valentine&rsquo;s Day specials</a>. Plus, let&rsquo;s not forget the best part of all, that we are 100% open with fantastic conditions. As you plan your trip please keep in mind lift tickets are limited and days are close to selling out, so plan ahead if you want to hit the slopes next week.
