</h6><p style="color: #696969; font-weight: 900; font-size: 12px;">SUNDAY, JANUARY 10</p><p>It has been a beautiful sunny Sunday on the slopes with packed powder across all eight peaks. Keep on shredding out there until last chair. Rest up tonight, because we have a stellar week ahead of us. With mild temps, beautiful snow conditions, and new open terrain, you will want to take some mid-week days off to enjoy it. The groomers will head out tonight once the sun goes down to press out perfect stripes for tomorrow, including Airglow. Snowmakers are also going to have snow flying on trails like White Heat, 3D, Cowardly Lion, Lost Princess, Downdraft, and Wildfire tonight. Lifts will open at 9AM tomorrow as we return to our mid-week schedule.</p><p>Looking ahead, we're pushing to add even more terrain for the three-day Martin Luther King Jr. weekend and offering <a href="/special-deals/mlk-lodging" title="MLK lodging sale">20% off resort lodging</a>. Both of our slopeside hotels are ski-in/ski-out and have access to green terrain.&nbsp;</p><p>All three base areas lodges are open with full services at South Ridge including season pass pickup, shopping, and rentals. There are several additional&nbsp;<a style="font-style: inherit;" href="https://www.sundayriver.com/river-guide"><strong>dining options</strong></a>&nbsp;around the resort, but please keep in mind that capacity is limited.</p><p><strong>Lift ticket pick up</strong>: Fast and contactless ticket pickup is available at our PUBs (Pick Up Boxes) throughout the resort. Just scan the barcode at the bottom of your confirmation email and your RFID cards will print with your lift tickets or ticket packs loaded. Don't forget to turn off dark mode on your phone if you use it.&nbsp;</p><p>As we continue to adjust resort operations to prioritize the safety of our guests, we are now&nbsp;<a title="Online Store" href="https://shop.sundayriver.com/s/lift-tickets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>requiring online lift ticket purchase</strong></a> or reloading and setting <strong>limits on the number of tickets sold</strong> for each day. This includes day, half-day, beginner, Threedom additional days, and Passholder Friend tickets. We only expect these limits to come into play on peak dates, but encourage everyone to buy early to ensure access on the dates you want. Season passes, Ikon passes, and lift ticket packs remain direct-to-lift with no restrictions or reservations.</p><p>Lastly, please remember to check our <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/covid">COVID Winter Guide</a> before each visit to make a plan for your day and stay on top of any potential changes. We&rsquo;re in this together and need your help.</p><p>See you tomorrow!</p><p>- Team Snow</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
