Morning Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: November 30, 2023 </strong></em><strong>| 7:32 AM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>Today has all the makings of a great ski day - groomed terrain, a nice chill in the air, and the wonderful sounds of snowmaking throughout the resort. Expansion is imminent, and we can't wait to continue to open more terrain. This morning, for as long as temperatures allow, there will be active snowmaking on Monday Mourning and at the junction around Sunday Punch.&nbsp;</p><p>Please be aware that there is no terrain connecting Jordan Bowl and Locke Mountain and you will need to pick your peak. With the ongoing Barker 6 construction, parking will be very limited at Barker. We recommend heading to South Ridge to park and catching the shuttle over for Locke access.&nbsp;</p><p>Lastly, here are some details to keep in mind before you go out and enjoy the day:</p><ul><li>Tonight is the last night of our <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/cyber-sale" title="Cyber Sale | Sunday River, Maine">Cyber Sale,</a> with deep discounts on lodging, lift tickets, ticket packs, and other deals.
