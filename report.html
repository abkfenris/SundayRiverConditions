There is plenty of fun to be had all across the mountain today, so hop on first chair at 8AM and make your way from Jordan Bowl to White Cap. To top it all off, you'll be enjoying some seasonable temperatures and sunshine while you explore all eight peaks. If you're just beginning, stick to the slopes of South Ridge and the terrain off of Little White Cap. Please note that lower T72 will be closed today for an event.</span></p><p><span>If you get hungry while on the slopes today we have plenty of food options to enjoy. Order online, head to the South Ridge takeout window, or make a reservation at one of our <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/river-guide">resort dining locations</a>.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;Take advantage of the day and enjoy your meals outside on the decks and picnic areas.&nbsp;</span></span></p><p>Want to hit the slopes in March?
