<h4><strong>January 4, 2023 | 2:40 PM</strong></h4><h2><strong>Afternoon Update</strong><span></span></h2><p>Good afternoon! Today's conditions varied throughout the resort from firm and fast to softer, heavier but more playful snow. The overcast clouds lowered visibility but kept the warmer temperatures from affecting the snow's top layer. Short lift lines and low rider traffic prevented skied off trails and allowed them to remain smooth and soft throughout the day.</p><p>Late tonight and into the morning, once temps allow, our snowmakers will be up and running on the mountain making new snow all over Jordan and Aurora peak. They will continue to build snow piles in recently troubled areas for the groomers to push around and patch things up as well as make snow on new terrain inorder to open more trails in the near future.</p><p>Snowcats will make their way out around the same time, grooming as much of the mountain, if not all, the trails we currently have available to ski and ride. We are constantly asking mother nature for more snow, but at this point, we will take cold enough temps to make the snow ourselves. Let's hope the upcoming weather provides the snow and temps we are all looking for.
