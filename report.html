<h5>December 16, 2021</h5><p>Good morning Sunday River! Welcome to another day of skiing and riding on the <strong>most open terrain in the east.</strong> The groomers got after it late last night, putting stripes down across the mountain. Mother Nature followed suit with a little snow resort-wide, which means you can expect soft turns on top of perfect corduroy. The snowmakers took advantage of the cold temps overnight and continued their efforts for more terrain, continuing to bury trails like Rogue Angel, Airglow, and Cowardly Lion. With weather clearing by early morning, it&rsquo;s shaping up to be a great day on the slopes.</p><p>Jordan Bowl is opening by next weekend, at which point both hotels will feature ski-in/ski-out trails for your convenience. Please note that our only beginner terrain is available within the South Ridge Express Quad at this time. With this in mind, skiing into the Grand Summit Hotel is currently accessible via blue terrain. Although the White Cap Lodge and Grand Summit Hotel are now ski-in/ski-out, all skier services including shopping and guest service are temporarily concentrated to Barker and South Ridge Lodges. We have almost 50 trails full of corduroy, so come carve the slopes with us!</p><p><strong>Around the Resort</strong></p><p>Join us at <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/winterfest-weekend.xml" title="winterfest weekend">Winterfest Weekend</a> for some holiday cheer!
