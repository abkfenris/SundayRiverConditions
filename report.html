</h6><p style="color: #696969; font-weight: 900; font-size: 12px;">SATURDAY, JANUARY 23</p><p><strong>1:30PM UPDATE: the White Heat Quad, Aurora Peak Quad, and Jordan Mountain Express are currently on wind hold.</strong></p><div>We are all about optimism here, but today's winds caused a few wind holds around the resort and unfortunately they are only increasing and will continue to do so into tomorrow.&nbsp;We're expecting many of our lifts to be on hold and there will most likely only be access to lower elevation terrain. It will be a truly rugged Maine day with cold temps and gusty winds, so if you do decide to head out there or try out the uphill gear, make sure you bundle up.&nbsp;Fireworks at South Ridge are cancelled for tonight, but twilight skiing will continue until 6:30PM as long as Mother Nature allows.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>This winter, your car is your base lodge. We're here to help you make the most of it by<a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/gear-up-giveaway"> giving away over $1,000 in gear from YETI </a>to help you boot up in the morning, grab a quick lunch between laps, and kick back for apr&egrave;s.</div><div></div><div>Dreaming of a wintery getaway? One-night stays are now available this weekend for the Jordan Hotel and the Snow Cap Inn. We are experiencing high call volume in our call center and recommend using our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/booklodging" style="font-style: inherit;"><strong style="font-style: inherit;">online booking engine</strong></a>&nbsp;for quotes or reservations.&nbsp;</div><div></div><p>There are plenty of food options around the resort for spreading out, but please remember that capacity is limited. Take a look at the <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/river-guide">River Guide</a> to discover locations, hours, online ordering, and how to make a reservation. For any needs such as season pass pickup, shopping, tuning, rentals, and SnowSports School, head to South Ridge Lodge.</p><p>We are&nbsp;<a title="Online Store" href="https://shop.sundayriver.com/s/lift-tickets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>requiring online lift ticket purchase</strong></a>&nbsp;and setting <strong>limits on the number of tickets</strong>&nbsp;sold for each day. This includes full-day, half-day, beginner, Threedom additional days, and Passholder Friend tickets. We only expect these limits to affect peak dates, but encourage everyone to buy early to ensure access on the dates you want. Season passes, Ikon passes, and lift ticket packs remain direct-to-lift with no restrictions or reservations.</p><p>Fast and contactless lift ticket pickup is available at our PUBs (Pick Up Boxes) at base lodges and hotels. Just scan the barcode at the bottom of your confirmation email and your RFID cards will print with your lift tickets or ticket packs loaded. For best results turn off dark mode on your phone if you use it and avoid email apps that use dark backgrounds.</p><p>Please remember to take a self-administered <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/covid" title="Health Screening">Health Screening</a> and visit our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/covid">COVID Winter Guide</a>&nbsp;before each trip to stay up-to-date on safety protocols and state guidelines.&nbsp;</p><p>Masks up!</p><p>- Team Snow</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
