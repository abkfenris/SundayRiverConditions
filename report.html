<h4><strong>February 18, 2023 | 6:30 AM</strong></h4><h4><strong style="font-size: 2em;">Morning Report</strong></h4><p>Presidents' week has finally arrived, and we hope you can find the time to get up to the mountains. This morning will start somewhat chilly, with temperatures around 10 degrees. As the sun begins to come out, we will see temps rise to the mid-20s by lunchtime. Mostly sunny skies and fair winds are forecasted today, setting us up for a lovely February day to be outside.</p><p>Our snowpack has undergone many changes in the last few days without sustained cold temperatures. After a long night of grooming, our trails will surely be firm and fast for most of the day today. Conditions will vary on the mountain depending on when it was groomed last night and how much time the trail has spent in the sun. Our natural snow off trails and in the woods has locked up and is pretty solid. These trails will start the morning closed until the sun can soften the snow enough for ski patrol to deem them safe to ride.</p><p>It's going to be a great day to explore all eight peaks in search of your favorite trail.&nbsp; As we kick off Presidents' week, make sure to check out everything we have going on throughout our resort. From Twilight Skiing all week long to bands, fire works, and live entertainment, there is always something going on during the holidays here at Sunday River. We are seeing some good signs of snowfall at some point later next week, which is a great reason to take advantage of our<a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/resort-lodging"> one-night stays</a> now available for Presidents' Week. All properties, all week, grab yours before they're gone!&nbsp;</p><p><span style="color: #0e101a;">We'll see you out there!</span><o:p></o:p></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true"><span style="color: #0e101a;">-Team Snow</span><o:p></o:p></span></p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
