Morning Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: April 21, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 6:19 AM</strong></h5><p>Good morning fellow snow enthusiasts, we've got a stunning spring day coming at you! The sun is shining, the birds are chirping, and the snow is just waiting to get skied on. Currently we've got temps in the low 30s at Jordan summit and a bit warmer in the basin. Things will start out a little crunchy as it did get down below freezing briefly, but temps are expected to warm up and the sun should help soften conditions by later this morning.</p><p>All typically groomed terrain got buffed out last night. You can expect less rowdy conditions on Lollapalooza, Rogue Angel, Excalibur, Northern Lights, Firestar, and of course Boots On and Off. Keep in mind this is still spring skiing and there is <strong>no beginner terrain available</strong>. As your legs warm up and you venture into our ungroomed terrain, please feel empowered to examine the backside of some of the larger snow features before skiing over them. Snow does funky things as it starts to melt and can create some unexpected obstacles.</p><p>Our<a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/season-passes"> New England Pass Spring Sale</a> is still availble until April 30.
