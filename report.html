Afternoon Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: January 29, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 1:30 PM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>The sun may not have shown up today, but it was still a great day on the slopes. The snow stayed consistent and carvable all day long, with plenty of soft turns for those who looked. Coming at you in the short term is some colder weather. Finally! At the time of this report, temps are already on the decline and snowmaking is jumping at the opportunity, lighting up White Heat and Lost Princess throughout the day. They'll look to keep hammering those trails in the current cold snap.</p><p><a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/pride-weekend" title="Pride Weekend | Sunday River, Maine">Pride Weekend</a> is next weekend, and <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/presidents-week" title="Presidents' Week | Sunday River, Maine">Presidents' Week</a> is right around the corner.
