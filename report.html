With temps in the 40s and plenty of sunshine on the slopes, you can expect soft snow across all eight peaks today. But don't bust out the shorts and Hawaiian shirts just yet. Winter is set to make a comeback this weekend with flurries and snowmaking. Until then, shed a layer, slap on some sunscreen, and join us for first chair at 9AM. Please note that Lower T72 will open late this morning as our parks crew finishes up a feature refresh.&nbsp;</p><p><span>The <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/season-passes" title="Season Passes">2021-22 New England Pass is back on sale</a>, granting access to Sunday River, Loon &amp; Sugarloaf all next year. Current passholders can take advantage of renewal rates and new passholders can start using their pass on March 22 when paid in full. With options that fit your budget and schedule, lock in the lowest rates on next year's pass now through April 30.</span></p><p>We&nbsp;<a title="Online Store" href="https://shop.sundayriver.com/s/lift-tickets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">require online purchase of lift tickets</a>&nbsp;and limit&nbsp;the number of tickets<span>&nbsp;sold for each day. This includes full-day, beginner, Threedom additional days, and Passholder Friend tickets.
