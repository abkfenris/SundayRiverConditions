It might've been a soggier and later start to the day, but the snow was still top notch corn all across Jordan and Oz. We'd love to give a HUGE thank you to all of our team members who kept the snow moving, the lifts spinning, and the burgers flipping all season long. None of this would have been possible without you.</p><p>As we look ahead, Sping Sale rates on <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/season-passes">2024-25&nbsp; New England Passes </a>are still available until April 30. April 30 is also the last chance to renew your pass from last year, take advantage of 0$ down, 0% financing for qualified purchasers, and secure Youth Gold passes for <strong>just $599.</strong> Winter will be back in no time, so lock in your next season for less.</p><p>With May right around the corner, it's about time to celebrate the favorite mom in our lives. Why not take her out to brunch? Camp is hosting <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/mom">Mother's Day Brunch</a> on May 12, and will have an incredible feast to celebrate mom.</p><p>That's about it. Things will be pretty quiet around here until we start up for summer activities, but don't sweat it, 2024-25 will be here before you know it.</p><p><span>We'll see you soon.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">- Team Snow</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
