<h4><strong>February 7, 2023 | 1:25 AM</strong></h4><h4><strong style="font-size: 2em;">Afternoon Report</strong></h4><p>Yesterday was great, but today might have just topped it. Blue sky, perfect snow, and tons of fun all around. Safe to say that we did indeed find our Happy Place today.&nbsp;</p><p>Once the sun sets and the temps drop, our grooming and snowmaking teams will make their way out onto the hill. Snowmaking will look to keep adding to Shock Wave, Top Gun, and a few others, and the cats will lay down that cord from Jordan to White Cap, and plenty in-between.&nbsp;</p><p>Enjoy the rest of the afternoon and soak up that sun!</p><p>&nbsp;See you out there!<br />-Team Snow</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
