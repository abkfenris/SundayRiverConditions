Morning Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: January 28, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 6:35 AM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>No Sunday scaries, here. We&rsquo;re looking at temperatures in the mid-to-low thirties, with little to no wind. We&rsquo;re starting our day off with 822 acres and 18 lifts. Just over half of our open terrain has new corduroy on it, so get out there and carve it up. If natural terrain is more your style, duck into the trees for some bumps and powder stashes. There&rsquo;s something here for everyone.</p><p>Our grooming team hit the hill hard last night, laying down stripes on our usual list of groomed terrain and beginning work on some upcoming terrain. Our snowmaking team will turn the guns back on in the next few days as soon as the temps drop down enough. Our parks team will continue working on Upper T72, and they&rsquo;ll start on Rocking Chair and Starlight this coming week.</p><p><a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/pride-weekend" title="Pride Weekend | Sunday River, Maine">Pride Weekend</a> is next weekend, and <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/presidents-week" title="Presidents' Week | Sunday River, Maine">Presidents' Week</a> is right around the corner.
