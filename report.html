We are anticipating high winds today. Please keep an eye on lift status updates.&nbsp;</p><p style="color: #696969; font-weight: 900; font-size: 12px;">MONDAY, MARCH 1</p><div><p><span>What a weekend. The snow was fantastic with big flakes falling across the mountain and endless skiing and riding on all eight peaks. This morning Mother Nature is feeling a bit moody sending us a wintery mix and breezy winds to kick off March. Please note the wind is forecasted to increase throughout the day today, so keep an eye on our &ldquo;Lift Status&rdquo; below for updates on wind holds. The Chondola cabins will remain off today and tomorrow. Last night the groomers were out on the slopes laying down stripes from peak to peak. Carve up the corduroy and enjoy slashing up the soft snow down low with these seasonable temps. Lifts will start spinning at 9AM.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p><span>Looking ahead, we will be enjoying lots of sunshine on the slopes later in the week and this weekend. March always brings us the best sunshine and some snowy surprises. It&rsquo;s never too early to start planning your next <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/resort-lodging">weekend getaway</a>.</span></p><p><span>If you get hungry while on the slopes today we have plenty of food options to enjoy. Order online, head to the South Ridge takeout window, or make a reservation at one of our <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/river-guide">resort dining locations</a>.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;Take advantage of the day and enjoy your meals outside on the decks and picnic areas.&nbsp;</span></span></p><p><span>We&nbsp;</span><a title="Online Store" href="https://shop.sundayriver.com/s/lift-tickets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>require online lift ticket purchase</strong></a><span>&nbsp;and set&nbsp;</span><strong>limits on the number of tickets</strong><span>&nbsp;sold for each day. This includes full-day, beginner, Threedom additional days, and Passholder Friend tickets. We only expect these limits to affect peak dates, but encourage everyone to buy early to ensure access on the dates you want. Season passes, Ikon passes, and lift ticket packs remain direct-to-lift with no restrictions or reservations.</span></p><p><span>Fast and contactless lift ticket pickup is available at our PUBs (Pick Up Boxes) at base lodges and hotels. Just scan the barcode at the bottom of your confirmation email and your RFID cards will print with your lift tickets or ticket packs loaded. For best results turn off dark mode on your phone if you use it and avoid email apps that use dark backgrounds.</span></p><p><span>Please remember to take a self-administered </span><a title="Health Screening" href="https://www.sundayriver.com/covid">Health Screening</a><span> and visit our&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/covid">COVID Winter Guide</a><span>&nbsp;before each trip to stay up-to-date on safety protocols and state guidelines.</span></p><p><span>Masks up!</span></p><p><span>Team Snow</span></p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
