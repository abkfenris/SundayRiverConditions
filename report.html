Afternoon Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: April 11, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 1:40 PM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>It's definitely a little soggy out there, but the snow is firing! Talk about hero snow, right? We've got some areas that are starting to get a bit thin, so please respect any closed trail signs. As we move into the final days of the season, keep in mind that the Jordan Hotel is still ski-in/ski-out, but the Grand Summit is just ski-in. Tomorrow looks...um...super, super humid. Might as well just say it, we've got rain and wind in the forecast tomorrow. Not an ideal combination, but fortunately it looks to clear out for the weekend festivities.</p><p>This weekend we've got a full slate of activities! Saturday is the crowd favorite <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/pond-a-palooza" title="Pond-A-Palooza">Pond-A-Palooza</a> happening at 11AM in South Ridge. Registration is first come, first served, so if you want to make a splash (so to speak), get there early to secure your spot. Then on Sunday we've got the <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/the-great-tailgate" title="Great Tailgate">Great Tailgate</a> in Barker and our annual <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/free-passholder-lunch" title="Passholder Appreciation Lunch">Passholder Appreciation Lunch</a> in South Ridge.</p><p>Please be cautious while skiing into the South Ridge basin as we've got teams prepping the pond for Pond-A-Palooza. There is a path on the Chondola side of the pond to ski passed it, but please avoid skiing on the side or climbing up the pond for any reason.</p><p><strong>Spring operations schedule:</strong></p><p>Midweek operations will only consist of Jordan, Barker, the Chondola, and Spruce, which means we no longer have true beginner terrain available. Our full Spring operations schedule can be found <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/spring">here</a>.</p><p>Ski-in access to the Grand Summit Hotel is still in play but keep an eye here for updates as the snowpack melts.</p><p>We'll see you out there!</p><p>- Team Snow</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
