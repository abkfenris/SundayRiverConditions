Afternoon Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: November 21, 2023 </strong></em><strong>| 2:07PM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>Two reasons to dance this afternoon. The first is to celebrate the heck of a day in Western Maine. The sky stayed mostly clear, the temps stayed on the colder side, and the skiing was superb. The second reason to dance comes after a peek at the radar (both out of joy and ritual). Our groomers will take to Jordan Bowl this evening to lay fresh stripes on Lollapalooza and Rogue Angel, setting up the perfect base to collect the fresh, natural snow that's expected to fall overnight through tomorrow. It's hard saying what this first storm will bring, but we seem to fall in the highest snowfall range on each of the radars we've seen, with some predicting a potential for 8+ inches. You know what they say, the early bird gets the first, fresh, powdery tracks.&nbsp;</p><p>For those needing ticket assistance, a Guest Service station is located in the bottom terminal of the Jordan 8. All Ikon Pass holders who need assistance must visit the Welcome Center in the South Ridge Base Lodge. Additionally, from now until December 1, all rentals for Type 2 skiers and above, can be made, in person only, at the Sunday River Rental Shop. The equipment rental shop is located in the tunnel at the South Ridge base area.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Please note that early-season, variable terrain will be present on all trails. Lastly, don't forget to check out our <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/early-season" title="Early Season Guide | Sunday River, Maine">Early Season Guide</a>.</p><p><span>Locke Mountain will continue to serve as the resort's dedicated early-season training venue for our partners Gould Academy and Bates College, as well as for pre-booked ski teams only. All public access to snow surfaces will be through the Jordan Bowl.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Please note that as crews work to expand the resort, all uphill travel is prohibited. The current <a href="/mountain-report#uphill_status">Uphill Route Status</a> can be found at the bottom of the Mountain Report. Also, all construction areas remain off-limits. Thank you in advance for allowing our crews the space to safely expand our terrain and complete the last steps of exciting new projects.</span></p><p>As always, keep an eye here for the latest info on our lift and trail status, as well as any other operational updates.</p><p>Think cold!</p><p>- Team Snow</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
