Afternoon Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: February 24, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 1:30 PM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>Temperatures stayed steady throughout the morning, and they'll likely begin dropping soon. Gone are the soft turns of yesterday afternoon, and in its place is some fast snow, perfect for carving. A bit of a breeze has picked up this afternoon, but don't let that stop you from enjoying the sunshine and blue skies. Be sure to keep an eye on the lift and terrain status below for the most updated information.&nbsp;</p><p>There will not be any snowmaking tonight, and our snowmaking team won't return to the hill until Monday night. Our grooming team will be giving us the same list of groomed trails as last night, so we're looking at 81 trails with fresh stripes for tomorrow morning. The Quantum Leap Triple and the Jordan Mountain Double will both open at 8AM tomorrow, and the Aurora Quad will remain on hold. Lower Airglow and Supernova will be closed, but Northern Lights, Lower Vortex, Paradigm, and Sensation will remain open.</p><p>It's never a bad time to review the Skier Responsibility Code. Take a moment, refresh yourself before heading out, and please remember to go slow in the base areas.</p><p><a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/presidents-week" title="Presidents' Week | Sunday River, Maine">Presidents' Week</a> schedule remains jam-packed, and tonight is the ultimate kid's night.
