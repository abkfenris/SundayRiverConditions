<h4><strong>January 7, 2023 | 1:30PM</strong></h4><h2><strong>Afternoon Update</strong><span></span></h2><p>Good afternoon Sunday River shredders. Today brought a mixture of freshly groomed trails and a playful dusting on the top surface. Some areas of the resort had variable conditions, mostly in areas that received colder temps last night or high ski traffic throughout the day.</p><p>After night skiing wraps up at 6:30, our Mountain Ops team will head out to do their thing, making snow and grooming trails. Snow guns will be turned on all over the resort, creating a fresh layer of snow on trails such as Excalibur, Obsession, American Express, and a few others here and there until early morning. Groomers will hit the slopes in the Snowcats to groom and smooth out as much of the resort as they can get to overnight.</p><p>The weather tomorrow seems pretty similar to today, with temps in the mid 20s to low 30s. Clouds should burn off early in the morning, and the sun should shine bright throughout operation hours.</p><p><strong>Please note:</strong> There is currently no beginner terrain into and out of the Grand Summit Hotel.</p><p>Visiting Sunday River anytime soon?
