<h4><strong>March 14, 2023 | 7:18 AM</strong><strong></strong></h4><h4><strong style="font-size: 2em;">Morning Report</strong></h4><p>Happy Snow Day! Snow moved in last night, dropping a healthy 2" at the base, with Mountain Ops reporting 3-4" across the peaks. We were only expecting an inch or two out of this first round, so this overperformance is wonderful to see. We're expecting a break in the action this morning, with the meat of the storm coming in throughout the afternoon. This second wave could drop as much as 6-8" if everything goes to plan.</p><p>For today, skiers and riders can expect wonderful soft turns across all eight peaks. Grooming had a successful night as well, smoothing out 80 trails prior to snow moving in. Wind has the potential to impact lift operations today. We are currently in good shape with all scheduled lifts planning to spin for 9 AM, but as always, keep your eyes on the Mountain Report for the most up-to-date lift status.</p><p>A final reminder, t<strong>he Spring</strong><strong>&nbsp;Flash Sale for New England Passes ends <em>tonight at midnight</em>.&nbsp;</strong>Qualified purchasers can take advantage of 0$ down, 0% interest on their purchase, plus,&nbsp;<strong>all</strong> season passes are valid for use next Monday, March 20. <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/season-passes" title="Season Passes | Sunday River">Find your perfect pass now</a>, and lock in your winter for less.</p><p>Think snow!<br />-Team Snow&nbsp;</p><h4></h4></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
