Afternoon Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: January 10, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 1:26 PM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>Today was a wild one. It began with 15" of snow, transitioned into rain, and now we've got blue skies and wind gusts. The natural snow we got allowed us to open ten new trails, including Locke Line, Wizard's Gulch, Airglow, and Lower Caramba. Wind holds limited access to some of our new terrain, but the winds are currently forecasted to ease up by tonight and into tomorrow. Who knows- we might get a few flurries tomorrow, and there's even more snow coming on Friday.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Our snowmakers will have a maintenance night tonight, and they'll be out and around the mountain, positioning snow guns on new trails. Our grooming team will hit a similar list of terrain tonight, with today's new terrain staying natural. Tempest will likely stay whalebacked through tomorrow.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/special-deals/dash-deals-sale" title="Dash Deals | Sunday River, Maine">Dash Deals</a> are already winding down.
