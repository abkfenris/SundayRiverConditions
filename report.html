<p><strong>November 18, 2022 | 8:00 AM</strong></p><p>Thank you to everyone who made it out yesterday for the first laps of the season. We have another great day of skiing and riding under bluebird skies this morning.&nbsp; The Locke Triple will begin spinning at 9:00 AM for New England Pass, Ikon Pass, and Ticket Pack holders. Daily lift ticket access will begin tomorrow,&nbsp; November 19 at 8:00 AM. Downloading at mid-station is encouraged. Last chair will be thrown at 3:15PM, so be sure to give yourself enough time to get some laps in.</p><p>Pre-season conditions will exist. Please ski in control, and be aware of changing terrain. Snowmaking operations will be ongoing throughout the day on T2 and Sunday Punch. It never hurts to keep a buff or something similar in your jacket pocket to keep the precipitation off your goggles. At this time, there is <strong>no beginner terrain</strong> available on the mountain. In addition to this, due to limited terrain availability, <strong>no uphill traffic is permitted at this</strong>&nbsp;<strong>time.&nbsp;</strong>Our team continues to work exceptionally hard to take advantage of the prolonged cold and open additional acreage as quickly as possible.&nbsp;</p><p>If you do not have your RFID GoCard from last season and still need to pick up your season pass, we encourage you to stop by the Welcome Center in South Ridge to do so before heading over to Barker.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/equipment-rentals/skier-type-classification" target="_blank" title="Skier Type Classification " rel="noopener"> Type II and Type III</a> rentals are currently available in the Discovery Center at South Ridge. As a note, with no beginner terrain available, we are not offering beginner rental equipment at this time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>It's not too late to secure your <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/season-passes" title="Season Passes | Sunday River">New England Pass</a> or <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/ticket-packs">Maine Ticket Pack</a>.
