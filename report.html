Afternoon Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: November 28, 2023 </strong></em><strong>| 1:57PM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>A good day, indeed! We had a few clouds roll through today, but a few of those clouds brought flurries with them. Always a welcomed surprise in our books! The weather pattern we're in looks like it will continue tomorrow. Temps drop into the teens overnight, giving our snowmakers and grooming team a great opportunity to continue making snow and smooth out open terrain, leaving perfectly striped cord behind and ready for you tomorrow morning.</p><p>Please be aware that there is no terrain connecting Jordan Bowl and Locke Mountain and you will need to pick your peak. There will be no downloading on Locke Triple. With the ongoing Barker 6 construction, parking will be very limited at Barker. We recommend heading to South Ridge to park and catching the shuttle over for Locke access.&nbsp;</p><p>Lastly, we've officially kicked off our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/cyber-sale" title="Cyber Sale | Sunday River, Maine">Cyber Sale,</a> with deep discounts on lodging, lift tickets, ticket packs, and other deals.
