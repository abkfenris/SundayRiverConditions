<h5>January 16, 2022</h5><p>We don't want to wish away the sunshine and blue skies that we've been enjoying today, but when there's <strong>a foot of snow in the forecast</strong>, you can't blame us for looking ahead to tomorrow. Our grooming team is prepping for the pow day by laying down stripes on over 70 trails, including South Paw, overnight. We're expecting snow to begin falling around sunrise and with steady flakes throughout the day for nonstop refills. Don't forget, we open at 8AM tomorrow for the holiday, so set your alarm now to make sure you're here for first chair.</p><p>Please note that ski-in access to the Jordan Hotel requires the navigation of intermediate trails to reach Jordan Bowl.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Around the Resort</strong><o:p></o:p></p><p>Don't miss 100,000 lights in the forest tonight at <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/winter-activities/apres-aglow" target="_blank" title="activity" rel="noopener">Apr&egrave;s Aglow</a>.
