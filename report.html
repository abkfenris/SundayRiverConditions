Comfortable temps have moved into the area this afternoon, and the sun is shining away. It's been an incredible day on the slopes, and tomorrow is looking even better.</p><p>Our snowmaking team will be back on the hill this evening after a well-deserved break and will be taking advantage of the cold temps to pump out the cold smoke onto White Heat and Excalibur, plus some other spots. Those trails will be ungroomed in the morning and will have incredible man-made powder from top to bottom.&nbsp;</p><p>The grooming team will also be back on the hill this evening and will be resurfacing trails across all eight peaks.With more sunshine in the surface, it's going to be an excellent day to rip some cord in the morning.</p><p><a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/presidents-week" title="Presidents' Week | Sunday River, Maine">Presidents' Week</a> is continuing, and our jam-packed events schedule is charging right along.
