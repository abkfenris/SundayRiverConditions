Groomers have <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrE6O76tiVQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">freshly pressed the corduroy</a>, the sun is shining, and we had a little refresh on Monday with 2-3" of snow. The snow is playful, fun, and perfect for a day of carving, or tree skiing, or park riding. For fun on the groomers, check out Risky Business or American Express. For some double black challenges, you can't go wrong on White Heat or Shock Wave. If you're a beginner, stick to the greens on South Ridge or venture over to Little White Cap Quad to try out the beginner terrain there, too. In preparation for the expected winds today, the Chondola cabins have been removed. The winds may affects our higher elevation lifts, so keep your eye out for lift status updates here and on the <a href="/sunday-river-app" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sunday River app</a>. &nbsp;</p><p>Want to hit the slopes in March?
