<p><strong>December 14, 2022 | 1:45 PM</strong></p><p>The wind was not in our favor today however, the skiing that was available was smooth and soft. The groomers did an outstanding job cleaning up the trails last night. Unfortunately, the Chondola and Spruce Peak Triple ended up on windhold for the day.</p><p>Looking into tomorrow, our Mountain Ops team will be hard at work again tonight, grooming out all open terrain. They will continue to blow snow throughout the resort in hopes of opening more of Whitecap, North peak, and Aurora as soon as possible. Temperatures seem pretty similar to today; however, the wind should calm down tomorrow, allowing us to open up all available lifts. If you are looking for a quiet day full of short lines and perfect groomers, then tomorrow might be that day for you!</p><p>Are you planning on making your way up here for the weekend?
