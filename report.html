Morning Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: April 15, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 7:30 AM</strong></h5><p>Happy Patriots' Day! Today marks our final midweek day of operation for the 2023-24 season, so let's make it count. Scheduled lifts for today are Barker 6, Spruce, and Jordan 8. That means South Ridge is closed for skiing, so don't expect lifts to be turning over in that area. White Cap is also closed for the season. Ropes have been drawn across those trails, so please respect trail closures.</p><p>Conditions should be pretty sweet today. It's about 40 degrees at the lower elevations and a few degrees cooler up top. It's on the cloudy side right now, but we're forecasted to get sunnier as the day progresses with temps getting up to about 50. It's truly spring skiing up here.</p><p>For additional information for spring operations, please visit our <a href="/spring">Spring Schedule</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>We will see you out there!</p><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">- Team Snow</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
