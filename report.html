Morning Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: April 28, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 6:35 AM</strong></h5><p>Here we go, folks. Today is our final day for the season and our annual 0$ Ski Day. Tickets for the day are free, but must still be "purchased" in the <a href="https://shop.sundayriver.com/s/lift-tickets/">online store to receive your RFID Go Card</a>. Thank you to everyone who made the 2023-24 ski season one we'll never forget.</p><p>For today, the Jordan 8 will spin from 8AM-4PM. Rogue Angel and Grand Ave did not receive a groom last night, but otherwise, we will have the same trails open as yesterday. Please be aware that trail conditions may change throughout the day, so ski in control, and have fun!</p><p>As we look ahead, Sping Sale rates on <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/season-passes">2024-25&nbsp; New England Passes </a>are still available until April 30. April 30 is also the last chance to renew your pass from last year, take advantage of 0$ down, 0% financing for qualified purchasers, and secure Youth Gold passes for <strong>just $599.</strong> Winter will be back in no time, so lock in your next season for less.</p><p>With May right around the corner, it's about time to celebrate the favorite mom in our lives.
