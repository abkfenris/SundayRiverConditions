<h4><strong>February 6, 2023 | 7:17 AM</strong></h4><h4><strong style="font-size: 2em;">Morning Report</strong></h4><p>Happy Monday to all! The weather currently is a bit topsy-turvy with a nice inversion making the summits a good 10-12 degrees warmer than the base areas. With that in mind, snowmaking last night was a bit hindered by that inversion and will try to get some guns running during the day. As temps allow, there's a chance for some snowmkaing to come online on Shock Wave and below the park on Starlight.&nbsp;</p><p>Also, did you hear that <strong>Caramba opened yesterday</strong>? If you and your legs are feeling up to the challenge, go check it out. Other than that, it's business as usual. Groomers hit all their usual targets and it should be a great day to kick off the week.</p><p>&nbsp;See you out there!<br />-Team Snow</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
