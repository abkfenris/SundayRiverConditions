Afternoon Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: February 28, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 2:12 PM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p><span>Well, today was a damp one, folks. The warmer weather gave us misty precipitation and soft turns. There are light winds, and temperatures have climbed out of the inversion throughout the day.</span></p><p><span>Throughout tonight and tomorrow, we will be experiencing higher winds and some generally unsettled weather. The good news? No rain tomorrow. Temperatures will drop down to the teens and single digits tonight as the winds pick up. We are anticipating wind holds tomorrow, and our grooming team will be focusing on a limited grooming plan tonight. Trails at upper elevations, such as White Heat, Airglow, and Cowardly Lion, will likely remain ungroomed.</span></p><p><span><span class="ui-provider a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z ab ac ae af ag ah ai aj ak" dir="ltr">Despite the incoming weather system, Friday is forecasted to be mostly sunny, with light winds and temps in the mid-twenties to mid-thirties. We have a solid snow base thanks to our excellent snowmaking team, and they're anticipating making even more snow on Thursday night. Stay tuned for some newly resurfaced and groomed terrain on Friday, and our grooming team </span></span><span><span class="ui-provider a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z ab ac ae af ag ah ai aj ak" dir="ltr">will be back out and laying corduroy on over 80 trails for the weekend.&nbsp;</span></span></p><p><span><span class="ui-provider a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z ab ac ae af ag ah ai aj ak" dir="ltr">Speaking of the weekend, we have a couple of events planned. Swing by the Demo Day on Saturday at White Cap for a chance to try some new equipment from top brands. We have some Sips &amp; Sweets at the Jordan Spa on Saturday, and stick around after twilight skiing to see a fire dancer. On Sunday morning, join Sunday River Christian Ministries for a mountaintop service on North Peak.&nbsp;</span></span></p><p>Lastly, it's never a bad time to review the Skier Responsibility Code. Take a moment, refresh yourself before heading out, and please remember to go slow in the base areas.</p><p>We'll see you out there!</p><p>- Team Snow</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
