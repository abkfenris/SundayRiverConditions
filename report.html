Today we have sunshine and stripes on tap for fantastic skiing and riding across all eight peaks. This is the kind of snow that squeaks under your boots and carves like a dream. With over 100 open trails there is a lot to enjoy out there. Start your week right and hop on first chair at 9AM.</p><p>Last night snowmakers continued to make snow on Lower Mixing Bowl and Quantum Leap. Conditions have been phenomenal, and the snowmakers keep striving to give us even more terrain to enjoy. Looking ahead, we have a beautiful week of skiing and riding, so make sure you get your mid-week bliss in.&nbsp;</p></div><div>This winter, your car is your base lodge. We're here to help you make the most of it by<a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/gear-up-giveaway"> giving away over $1,000 in gear from YETI </a>to help you boot up in the morning, grab a quick lunch between laps, and kick back for apr&egrave;s.</div><div></div><div>There are plenty of food options around the resort for spreading out, but please remember that capacity is limited. Take a look at the <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/river-guide">River Guide</a> to discover locations, hours, online ordering, and how to make a reservation.&nbsp;</div><p>We are&nbsp;<a title="Online Store" href="https://shop.sundayriver.com/s/lift-tickets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>requiring online lift ticket purchase</strong></a>&nbsp;and setting <strong>limits on the number of tickets</strong>&nbsp;sold for each day. This includes full-day, half-day, beginner, Threedom additional days, and Passholder Friend tickets. We only expect these limits to affect peak dates, but encourage everyone to buy early to ensure access on the dates you want. Season passes, Ikon passes, and lift ticket packs remain direct-to-lift with no restrictions or reservations.</p><p>Fast and contactless lift ticket pickup is available at our PUBs (Pick Up Boxes) at base lodges and hotels. Just scan the barcode at the bottom of your confirmation email and your RFID cards will print with your lift tickets or ticket packs loaded. For best results turn off dark mode on your phone if you use it and avoid email apps that use dark backgrounds.</p><p>Please remember to take a self-administered <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/covid" title="Health Screening">Health Screening</a> and visit our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/covid">COVID Winter Guide</a>&nbsp;before each trip to stay up-to-date on safety protocols and state guidelines.&nbsp;</p><p>Carve on!</p><p>Team Snow</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
