Morning Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: March 28, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 7:35 AM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>It certainly feels like spring today, with warm, inverted temperatures and some unfrozen precipitation. Temps are currently warmer up top, sitting in the low to mid-forties, and it's cooler down in the base areas. That should flip by late morning. It will likely rain on and off today, so bring a rain jacket with you to the mountain. Turns should be soft, winds will be light to nonexistent, and temps will stay warm.</p><p>Our grooming team laid corduroy on 78 trails last night, including all of our beginner terrain, most of our intermediate terrain, and some of our advanced terrain. Take a lap on trails like Cyclone, Ridge Run, and Moonstruck for some easy turns on new corduroy, or try a trail like Northern Lights, Obsession, or Sunday Punch for some more intermediate and advanced stripes. Please note that Excalibur and Airglow will remain ungroomed today. White Heat will also be closed through the weekend for Bust 'N' Burn.
