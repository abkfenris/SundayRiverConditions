<h4><strong>January 9, 2023 | 7:25 AM</strong></h4><h2><strong>Morning Update</strong><span></span></h2><p>Well it looks like Mother Nature finally decided to flip the switch to winter, which has opened the door for our snowmaking team to get back to business. Though you'll likely not encounter active snowmaking on the hill, several trails including Grand Rapids, Lost Princess, Lazy River, Obsession, and Heat's Off will have snowmaking coming offline just prior to opening and will not be groomed. The grooming team did hit the usual batch of trails around the mountain, so you can still find that perfect corduroy on plenty of terrain.</p><p>Temps are looking to be in the mid 20s-low 30s today, so it's shaping up to be a great day to be on the hill.</p><p>Today is also the start of <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/kids-week">Kid's week</a>&nbsp;at Sunday River. Make sure to check out all the deals and events we have planned for your little ones to enjoy.</p><p><strong>Please note:</strong> There is currently no beginner terrain into and out of the Grand Summit Hotel.</p><p>Visiting Sunday River anytime soon?
