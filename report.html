Morning Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: February 10, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 6:35 AM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>Happy Saturday, folks. It's going to be a warm one out there today, and we currently have a temperature inversion on the mountain, with temps in the mid-forties up top and high twenties down in the base. That should flip by this afternoon, and we're expecting temperatures in the high thirties at the summits and low forties in the base areas. With the sun just peeking through the clouds throughout the day, this looks like a great day to hit the slopes.&nbsp;</p><p>Our grooming team has been on the slopes all night, setting us up with some lovely corduroy on over half of our open terrain. All of our green terrain on White Cap, South Ridge, Merrill Hill, Aurora, and Jordan will be groomed, as well as the majority of our blue terrain. Three Mile Trail, Polaris, and Backside remain ungroomed. Upper Vortex was groomed out last night, so head over that way for some top-to-bottom stripes. Shock Wave is ungroomed and advanced terrain. Be sure to check out our lift and trail status below for the most up-to-date information throughout the day.&nbsp;</p><p>We have <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/winter-activities/night-skiing" title="Twilight Skiing | Sunday River, Maine">twilight skiing</a> skiing tonight off of the Chondola and the South Ridge Express.
