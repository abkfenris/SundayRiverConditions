Morning Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: November 15, 2023 </strong></em><strong>| 7:17 AM</strong></h5><p>Hope your legs aren't crushed from your first day back on snow, because we're back at it again today. Things are going to look pretty similar to yesterday; Lollapalooza, Boots On, and Boots Off received fresh stripes of corduroy, and Rogue Angel got some more attention from our snowmaking teams. The snow guns were shut off in the early hours of the morning, giving more time for the snow to set up. That said, please still exercise caution if electing to ski Rogue as it is still very much expert terrain.</p><p>New for today: daily lift tickets are now accepted. If you need ticket assistance, we have a Guest Service station located in the bottom terminal of the Jordan 8.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Please note, that there will be no beginner terrain available</strong> at the start of the season, and early-season, variable terrain will be present on all trails. Lastly, don't forget to check out our <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/early-season" title="Early Season Guide | Sunday River, Maine">Early Season Guide</a>.</p><p>A hike-park is set up in the Jordan Basin, with 4 features and a variety of rails and boxes.</p><p><span>Locke Mountain will serve as the resort's dedicated early-season training venue for our partners Gould Academy and Bates College, as well as pre-booked ski teams only. All public access to snow surfaces will be through the Jordan Bowl.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Please note that as crews work to expand the resort, all uphill travel is prohibited. The current <a href="/mountain-report#uphill_status">Uphill Route Status</a> can be found at the bottom of the Mountain Report. Also, all construction areas remain off-limits. Thank you in advance for allowing our crews the space to safely expand our terrain and complete the last steps of exciting new projects.</span></p><p>As always, keep an eye here for the latest info on our lift and trail status, as well as any other operational updates.</p><p>Think cold!</p><p>- Team Snow</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
