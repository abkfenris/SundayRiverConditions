Morning Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: January 30, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 7:35 AM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>It's hard to believe that January is almost over, but it's treated us pretty well so far. Nearly four feet of snow has fallen this month, we're skiing and riding on over 800 acres across all eight peaks, and it's only going to get better.</p><p>Snowmaking has continued its push, taking advantage of cold temps to bury trails like White Heat and Lost Princess in snow. We're chomping at the bit for the first turns of the year down the Heat, and we know you are too, so stay tuned for updates on when we expect to be able to open that trail.&nbsp;</p><p>Grooming had another productive night out on the slopes, working in the 2" that fell Sunday night into the trails. Our naturals are also still skiing well, thanks to the prolonged cold keeping the snow dry. Patrol will be doing some checks to see if any additional terrain will open, so keep an eye here for any updates throughout the day.</p><p>Looking ahead, <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/pride-weekend" title="Pride Weekend | Sunday River, Maine">Pride Weekend</a> is this weekend, and <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/presidents-week" title="Presidents' Week | Sunday River, Maine">Presidents' Week</a> is right around the corner.
