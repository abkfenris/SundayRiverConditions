There isn't a cloud in the sky today as we enjoy skiing and riding across all eight peaks under the endless sun. If you are not at the mountain, it's not too late, get out and soak up every bit of sun until last chair. Not to mention the snow is fun and fast. Tomorrow will look a little different with some snow flurries heading our way but whether it's sunshine or snow, we certainly can't complain.&nbsp;For today, keep working on your mask tan, and believe us when we say it&rsquo;s definitely the cooler version of a goggle tan.</span></p><p>Tomorrow lifts will start spinning at 9AM. Tonight the groomers will head out once the sun goes down to press out perfect stripes for another day of fast turns tomorrow.&nbsp;Over the weekend snowmakers resurfaced trails like American Express, Risky Business, Ecstasy, Right Stuff, and Sunday Punch, so you won&rsquo;t want to miss those.</p><p><span>The <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/season-passes" title="Season Passes">2021-22 New England Pass is back on sale</a>, granting access to Sunday River, Loon &amp; Sugarloaf all next year.
