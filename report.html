<h4><strong>February 11, 2023 | 6:30 AM</strong></h4><h4><strong style="font-size: 2em;">Morning Report</strong></h4><p>The weekend has arrived, and it's shaping up to be a good one. Our groomers took to the slopes early this morning, waiting for the ideal temps to get our mountain cleaned up and smoothed out. Our staff will head out to the lifts bright and early this morning to get them spinning and ready for the day ahead. <br />After a day of warmer temps, last night's drop in temps has locked up our natural terrain and is currently pretty dicey in some areas. Ski Patrol has decided to close some of these natural trails but will continue to inspect the conditions throughout the day. Please take caution when entering any natural areas, as snow conditions vary. With 100% of our lifts opening today and plenty of groomed trails throughout our eight peaks, there is still plenty of skiing and riding to be had on the trails. <br />The sun will shine strong for the day today, with temperatures hitting the high 20s to low 30s. The sun should help us soften up some of the firm snow that is unreachable by a snowcat, improving our conditions as the day goes on. It's another excellent weekend for heading to western Maine to enjoy the views and pleasant weather here at Sunday River.</p><p>Let's get this weekend started!<br />-Team Snow</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
