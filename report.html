We're gearing up for a bright and sunny day on the mountain. From peak to peak, you'll find fresh-pressed corduroy, including Upper Lost Princess, plus plenty of natural terrain too. We'll spin all 18 lifts today, with the first of them opening at 8AM. Throw on an extra layer, mask up, and we'll see you for first chair, folks.&nbsp;</span><span>T</span><span>hanks to all who visited us for a safe and fun <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/presidents-week" title="event listing">Presidents' Week</a> on the slopes!&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>We&nbsp;</span><a title="Online Store" href="https://shop.sundayriver.com/s/lift-tickets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>require online lift ticket purchase</strong></a><span>&nbsp;and set&nbsp;</span><strong>limits on the number of tickets</strong><span>&nbsp;sold for each day. This includes full-day, beginner, Threedom additional days, and Passholder Friend tickets. We only expect these limits to affect peak dates, but encourage everyone to buy early to ensure access on the dates you want. Season passes, Ikon passes, and lift ticket packs remain direct-to-lift with no restrictions or reservations.</span></p><p><span>Fast and contactless lift ticket pickup is available at our PUBs (Pick Up Boxes) at base lodges and hotels. Just scan the barcode at the bottom of your confirmation email and your RFID cards will print with your lift tickets or ticket packs loaded. For best results turn off dark mode on your phone if you use it and avoid email apps that use dark backgrounds.</span></p><p><span>Please remember to take a self-administered </span><a title="Health Screening" href="https://www.sundayriver.com/covid">Health Screening</a><span> and visit our&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/covid">COVID Winter Guide</a><span>&nbsp;before each trip to stay up-to-date on safety protocols and state guidelines.</span></p><p><span>Carve on,</span></p><p><span>Team Snow</span></p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
