<strong>Lift tickets are sold out for today and selling out for Presidents' Week. Please plan accordingly.</strong></p><p style="color: #696969; font-weight: 900; font-size: 12px;">SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 14</p><div><p>We have another beautiful day on tap with eight pretty peaks, mild temps, and drool-worthy conditions. To top things off, it looks like we have some snow heading our way tomorrow night. This Valentine&rsquo;s Day take your significant other to the slopes and show them your first true love, shredding at Sunday River. If you&rsquo;re single, well you don&rsquo;t really get to mingle, please keep a safe distance while at the resort. Masks are the latest fashion trend, so don&rsquo;t forget to keep yours up at all times unless actively skiing or sitting down to eat.</p><p>Last night the groomers worked their way across each peak laying down perfect stripes for today. Enjoy fun morning turns on trails like Lazy River, Risky Business, Escapade, Northern Lights, and Lollapalooza. Hop into the woods over on Jordan Bowl to search for secret stashes. If you&rsquo;re just learning, start the day at South Ridge for the best beginner terrain. If you&rsquo;re staying at the Grand Summit, there are also great green trails off of Little White Cap Quad for some mellow turns.</p><p style="font-style: inherit;">We have quite the line-up for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/presidents-week">Presidents&rsquo; Week</a> with twilight skiing every night, fireworks, and<a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/valentines-day"> Valentine&rsquo;s Day specials</a>.
