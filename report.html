Morning Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: January 23, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 7:32 AM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>Happy Tuesday, and welcome to another great day of skiing and riding. Temps will continue to moderate today before diving back into the teens tonight, making for delightful hero snow. For today, we've got 735 acres across all eight peaks scheduled for your enjoyment. Please note, winds are forecasted to be in the area throughout the morning and may impact lift operations.</p><p>Our snowmakers have continued to gain ground thanks to these cold temps over the last week. New terrain is open, snow has been stockpiled, and we've officially fired up the guns on White Heat. We're expecting to lose snowmaking temps later this week as some warmer temps move in, but rest assured, we'll be ready to jump on the next favorable weather window.</p><p>The grooming team was out again last night working their magic and resurfacing trails. They've also begun building more additional terrain, so keep an eye out for new trail openings.</p><p>We're officially into Senior Week, and we have a whole list of events, musical bingo, a comedy show, and karaoke. Find all of the details on our <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/senior-week" title="Senor Week | Sunday River, Maine">Senior Week</a> event page.
