Morning Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: March 18, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 7:30AM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>It's a beautiful morning here in Western Maine, and we are excited to get out and enjoy the snow. As we start the day, the snow might be a little crunchy, but as the temperature rises throughout the mid-morning, the snow will soften, making for some excellent turns in the afternoon.</p><p>Our grooming team has already been out and about, marking their signature stripes on our green terrain, most of our blue terrain, and some of our advanced terrain. Our natural terrain may not open this morning due to the low temperatures last night, but keep an eye on the report throughout the day for any changes. The terrain may open as the sun comes out.</p><p>Later this month, come check out events like <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/bust-n-burn" title="Bust 'N' Burn | Sunday River, Maine">Bust 'N' Burn</a> and <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/spring-fest-weekend" title="Sping Fest Weekend | Sunday River, Maine">Spring Fest Weekend</a> to find actvities for everyone in the family.
