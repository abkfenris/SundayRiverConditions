<h4><strong>February 9, 2023 | 7:30 AM</strong></h4><h4><strong style="font-size: 2em;">Morning Report</strong></h4><p>Rise and shine, fellow shredders; it's time to pack the car and get up here. We are starting our morning with bright skies, still winds, and mild temperatures. This warm weather will surely soften up our freshly groomed trails, creating excellent conditions for a fantastic Thursday of skiing and riding as the day goes on.</p><p>Our Mountain Ops team got to it last night and this morning, pushing snow around to smooth out our trails and lay down those beautiful stripes once again. Snowmakers took to a few closed trails to turn on the guns and put down as much snow as they could overnight. We hope to see Top Gun and Shockwave open soon, but we need some help from Mother Nature to add to the snowpack and get the trails safe to open. Hopefully, temps will begin to decline as precipitation is forecasted overnight. With over 750 acres of open terrain, there is plenty to explore and adventure, but our team is constantly striving to get our resort closer to being 100% open as the season continues.</p><p>&nbsp;See you at the top!<br />-Team Snow</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
