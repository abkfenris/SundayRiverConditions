Morning Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: March 6, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 7:35 AM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>We're in for another warm one today, folks, so we can expect some soft turns under partly sunny skies. Temps are currently inverted, with the peaks sitting at 40 and the basins seeing 32 right now, but that should flip throughout the day. Winds will be light and variable, and by this afternoon, we're anticipating temps in the low 50s at the base areas. Perfect deck weather.&nbsp;</p><p>Because of the warm temperatures and yesterday's unfrozen precipitation, our grooming team is looking to maintain and preserve our snowpack through a reduced grooming plan. There will be at least one trail off of every chair that is groomed top to bottom, and all of our open green terrain has been groomed. Get out there early for some corduroy on Salvation, Cascades, and Lollapalooza, or try your hand at some bumps on some of our ungroomed terrain. Check out the trail status below for a full list of groomed and ungroomed terrain.&nbsp;</p><p>While this weather pattern is certainly not ideal, we are in great shape for excellent end-of-March and April skiing, thanks to our dedicated snowmaking and grooming teams.</p><p><span>As always, check out the <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events">events calendar</a> for the lineup of activities and performances throughout the rest of the month.
