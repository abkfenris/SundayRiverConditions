It will likely stay cloudy today, and there's a chance for some flurries throughout the day. We have 111 trails open today, 752 acres of open terrain, and 19 scheduled lifts, ready for exploration.&nbsp;</p><p>Our grooming team was out on the hill last night, laying stripes on 73 trails. New additions include Cowardly Lion, Brilliant, Double Refraction, Spectra, and Prism. All of our green terrain, most of our blue terrain, and some of our advanced and expert terrain was groomed last night, so whether you want a more relaxed cruise or if you want to rip some groomers, there's an option for everyone. Check out our natural terrain, as well, with trails like Lost Princess and Gnarnia for some fun in the trees.
