Soft turns were plentiful throughout the day, making for excellent skiing and riding for those willing to brave the cloud cover. Unsettled weather is moving in this evening, which holds our snowmakers at bay until we regain adequate temps. The grooming team will pay a visit to South Ridge, grooming all green terrain, but will leave the rest of the mountain in its natural state to preserve as much snow as possible. Expansion efforts will continue the second we have the temperatures to do so.&nbsp;</span></span></p><p><span data-contrast="auto" xml:lang="EN-US" lang="EN-US" class="TextRun SCXW121676824 BCX0"><span class="NormalTextRun SpellingErrorV2Themed SCXW121676824 BCX0">Speaking of expansion, snowmaking heading into the White Cap basin and the Grand Summit Hotel has gone exceptionally well. If everything goes to plan, we're expecting intermediate-ability ski-in, ski-out access to the Grand Summit by this weekend. You may notice groomed terrain heading in that direction in the coming days. Lift access will not be available from the White Cap basin until this weekend, so please heed all signage and warnings posted by ski patrol.&nbsp;</span></span></p><p>We'll see you out there!</p><p>-Team Snow</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
