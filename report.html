<h4><strong>March 8, 2023 | 2:30 PM</strong><strong></strong></h4><h4><strong style="font-size: 2em;">Afternoon Report</strong></h4><p>The sun is shining bright, the snow is soft, and the trails were top-notch today. The wnd was pretty strong this morning but did not affect our lifts. Groomers easily gripped carving skis and kept smooth even after being skied off for a day. Gromers will get onto the slopes again tonight to redraw those stripes.</p><p>Tomorrow's weather looks similar to today's. It may be a little cloudier than today, and it will get a little warmer by mid-day. Another beautiful day is ahead of us. Perfect for getting in some laps and enjoying the views. March keeps providing more fantastic days of skiing with fresh snow and great weather.</p><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true"><a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/season-passes" title="Season Passes">2023-24 New England Passes are </a><strong><a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/season-passes" title="Season Passes">now on sale</a>. </strong>Take advantage of the chance to lock in your pass at the year's lowest prices during our one-week flash sale.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">We'll see you out there!<br /></span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">-Team Snow</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
