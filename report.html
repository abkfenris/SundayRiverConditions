Morning Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: April 9, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 7:35 AM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>Between cloudless skies, temps in the upper 50's, and a once-in-a-lifetime eclipse, yesterday was one to remember. Today is looking like it may be just as good, minus the Eclipse.&nbsp;</p><p>The grooming team spent the wee hours of the morning resurfacing trails following yesterday's spring turns. Thanks to recent snowfall, we're still skiing and riding on over 650 acres of terrain. Not bad for mid-April.</p><p>Please keep in mind our spring operations schedule as we move through the month. Midweek operations will only consist of Jordan, Barker, the Chondola, and Spruce, which means we no longer have true beginner terrain available. Our full Spring operations schedule can be found <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/spring">here</a>.</p><p>Ski-in access to the Grand Summit Hotel is still in play but keep an eye here for updates as the snowpack melts.</p><p>Looking ahead, we've got a weekend full of <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events" title="Events | Sunday River">classic Spring events</a>. Pond-a-palooza will be taking place on Sunday, with the Great Tailgate and Passholder Appreciation lunch on Sunday!&nbsp;</p><p>We'll see you out there!</p><p>- Team Snow</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
