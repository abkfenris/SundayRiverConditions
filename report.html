Monday Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: February 25, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 6:35 AM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>Temperatures are in the single digits right now, but they should rise steadily throughout the day. By later this afternoon, it should be solidly in the twenties across the mountain. Winds should be light and variable, the sun should be out, and the snow should be fast. Who will have first chair today?</p><p>Our grooming team gave us the same list of groomed trails as yesterday, so we're looking at 81 trails with fresh stripes. Take some relaxed turns like Lollapalooza and Moonstruck, or check out some classic cruisers like Right Stuff and Rogue Angel. There was no snowmaking last night, and our snowmaking team won't return to the hill until tomorrow night. The Quantum Leap Triple and the Jordan Mountain Double will both open at 8AM today, and the Aurora Quad will remain on hold. Lower Airglow and Supernova will be closed, but Northern Lights, Lower Vortex, Paradigm, Celestial, and Sensation will remain open.</p><p>It's never a bad time to review the Skier Responsibility Code. Take a moment, refresh yourself before heading out, and please remember to go slow in the base areas.</p><p>Have you looked at the new apr&egrave;s experience at the Alpeniglu at Sunday River? On Saturdays throughout the season, take a PistenBully cabin cat down to the igloo from Sliders and enjoy some sweets, drinks, and music, before taking the cat back up. <a href="https://shop.sundayriver.com/s/events/p/cat-ride-igloo-experience" title="Apres Experience | Sunday River, Maine">Tickets</a> are on sale now.&nbsp;</p><p>We'll see you out there!</p><p>- Team Snow</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
