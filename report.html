Afternoon Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: March 7, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 1:27 PM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>This morning's rain let up around midday, and while the sun isn't quite out, it's certainly bright. Turns are soft right now, but as temps drop throughout this afternoon and this evening, those turns should firm right up. Tomorrow will be warmer again, with highs in the mid-forties, and the sun will be out and shining.&nbsp;</p><p>And now, what we've all been hoping for: as long as the temps cool down enough tonight, our snowmaking team will be back out and at it. They're hoping to resurface a few trails, with some help from our grooming team. Our grooming team is also hoping to follow the full grooming plan, as long as temps cool down enough tonight. That will mean more groomed beginner terrain and more top-to-bottom groomers across the entire resort. The forecast looks good, but cross your fingers and think cold. Stay tuned tomorrow for the full list of groomed terrain.&nbsp;</p><p><span>Be sure to check out the <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events">events calendar</a> for the lineup of activities and performances throughout the rest of the month.
