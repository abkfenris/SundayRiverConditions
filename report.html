Morning Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: February 29, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 7:36 AM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>Temperatures plummeted throughout the night, and we're currently looking at temps in the low teens across the mountain. If there was ever a day to bundle up, it's today. Bring those hand warmers and buffs for a day of fast skiing on the hill.&nbsp;We are expecting wind holds today as we experience high winds. Keep an eye on the lift and terrain status below for the most updated information.&nbsp;</p><p>Due to the warmer temperatures of yesterday and the cooler temps of last night, we are looking at a firmer surface on the mountain today. Our grooming team was out through the night, laying corduroy on over 65 trails, where they were able to break up that firmer surface. Trails that remained ungroomed, like Airglow, Right Stuff, Vortex, and T2, will remain closed. Whoville will also be closed today, as our parks team works to reset some features.&nbsp;</p><p><span><span class="ui-provider a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z ab ac ae af ag ah ai aj ak" dir="ltr">Despite the weather of yesterday and the wind of today, tomorrow is forecasted to be mostly sunny, with light winds and temps in the mid-twenties to mid-thirties. Our snowmaking team is planning on getting back out there tonight, and we're hoping to have some newly resurfaced terrain as we head into the weekend.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p><p><span><span class="ui-provider a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z ab ac ae af ag ah ai aj ak" dir="ltr">Speaking of the weekend, we have a couple of events planned. Swing by the Demo Day on Saturday at White Cap for a chance to try some new equipment from top brands. We have some Sips &amp; Sweets at the Jordan Spa on Saturday, and stick around after twilight skiing to see a fire dancer. On Sunday morning, join Sunday River Christian Ministries for a mountaintop service on North Peak.&nbsp;</span></span></p><p>Lastly, it's never a bad time to review the Skier Responsibility Code. Take a moment, refresh yourself before heading out, and please remember to go slow in the base areas.</p><p>We'll see you out there!</p><p>- Team Snow</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
