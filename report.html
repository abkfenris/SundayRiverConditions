<h5>January 3, 2022</h5><p>We had a great morning full of corduroy and freshly made snow! Temperatures are ideal for snowmaking, and we have an exciting lineup to get even more terrain for you to enjoy. Groomers are putting down stripes on 8 peaks for you to carve into tomorrow. Snowmakers are blasting guns across the mountain on trails including White Heat, American Express, Tempest, and more. Scheduled lifts will be spinning from 9AM-3:45PM today and tomorrow, so take an afternoon run or grab first chair in the morning!&nbsp;</p><p>Both hotels are now ski-in/ski-out for your convenience. Please note when skiing into both hotels, navigating blue or more advanced terrain is required. At this time, there are no green trails accessible when skiing into the Grand Summit Hotel. When skiing into the Jordan Hotel, beginner terrain is limited to Jordan Peak via Lollapalooza, and skiing in from a different peak is currently considered advanced.</p><p><strong>Around the Resort</strong><o:p></o:p></p><p>Grab a bite at all our open restaurants and food trucks on the mountain, including <a href="/resort-dining/coffee-hound" title="coffee hound">Coffee Hound</a> in South Ridge Lodge Food Court, the Ona-Tripp Food Truck, and more.
