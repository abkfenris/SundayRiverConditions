<h4><strong>December 16, 2022 | 2:45 PM</strong></h4><h2><strong>Afternoon Report</strong></h2><p>The snow is still coming down, and some fresh turns are still around this afternoon. People were up and at it this morning, lining up for the first chair in high anticipation for the snow to start piling up. The wind was calm, and although the clouds came in strong, visibility was still excellent on the trails. Temperatures continue to stay within the 20s going into the night, and the snow isn't stopping anytime soon. We are expecting 10-14" by the end of this storm, wrapping up sometime Sunday morning.</p><p>Our Mountain Ops team will let Mother Nature do its thing tonight, turning off all snow guns and giving our team a well-deserved rest. The groomers will be out as soon as ski patrol closes the mountain to smooth out those skied-off areas and provide as much time as possible for the storm to pile snow on top for a great morning ahead. Depending on what happens tonight, we are looking at opening some new terrain at South Ridge, North Peak, and White Cap, and all three surface lifts at South Ridge will be open for the weekend. Try your best to get up here this weekend; with all this snow and <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/winterfest-weekend">Winterfest</a>, you will not want to miss out.</p><p>&nbsp;We will see you out there!<br />-Team Snow</p><p></p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
