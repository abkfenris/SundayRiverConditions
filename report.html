Morning Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: January 18, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 7:32 AM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>Today we&rsquo;re looking at temperatures in the high teens to mid-twenties, variable winds, and partly sunny skies. We&rsquo;re starting the day off with 11 lifts and 670 acres of open terrain. We have a good mix of groomed and all-natural terrain, so there&rsquo;s something for everyone. It&rsquo;s going to be a great day.</p><p>Our snowmaking team focused on trails on Little White Cap last night, and they also resurfaced trails like Jibe and Broadway. Our grooming team prepared the usual lineup of trails for us, and we can expect fresh stripes on over half of our terrain. Catch the corduroy on our groomed trails, or head over to Lost Princess, Blind Ambition, and Poppy Fields for some powder stashes in the trees. Jibe currently has active snowmaking, and it will remain ungroomed. Please be aware that Lazy River, Tourist Trap, Snowbound, and Obsession may have active snowmaking throughout the day. Check back here for the most updated trail status.&nbsp;</p><p>Searching for a quick weekend getaway? Look no further.
