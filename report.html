Morning Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: January 31, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 7:31 AM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>Today, temps will stay in the low twenties up top and high twenties down at the base. The clouds of this morning should burn off, leaving us with mostly sunny skies by this afternoon. With a midnight dusting of snow over new corduroy, today will be an excellent day for some midweek turns.&nbsp;</p><p>Our grooming team took care of our usual lineup of trails across the mountain, including our beginner terrain, most of our intermediate terrain, and some carving classics like Right Stuff, Tempest, and Obsession. Our snowmaking team had an excellent night as well, and they were able to blow snow on White Heat, Rocking Chair, and Cowardly Lion. Please be aware that there will be active snowmaking on Lost Princess, Monday Mourning, and Cascades. Those three trails will also remain ungroomed.&nbsp;</p><p>Looking ahead, <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/pride-weekend" title="Pride Weekend | Sunday River, Maine">Pride Weekend</a> is this weekend, and <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/presidents-week" title="Presidents' Week | Sunday River, Maine">Presidents' Week</a> is right around the corner.
