Head to the top of one of Sunday River's peaks for a cool breeze and phenomenal views of Western Maine, the White Mountains, and the Mahoosuc Mountains.<strong>&nbsp;Don't forget to bring plenty of water</strong>, sunscreen, a hat, and some salty snacks to replace what you sweat out. Water bottle filling stations are located in South Ridge Lodge, as well as the hotels!</p><p>Many of our trails involve sections on sunny work roads, so be prepared for maximum sun exposure. Make sure you check the forecast for thunderstorms! Long, humid days can brew up violent storms that can boom through the mountains with little notice. Keep an eye on a reliable, hourly forecast, and&nbsp;<strong>be prepared to head for shelter at the first sign of storms</strong>. Afternoon rains may make for wet trails the following morning.</p><p>Lowbush blueberries have come into season, especially on the upper mountain! If you choose to pick berries, a good practice is to take less than 1/10th of what is growing. This leaves berries for wildlife and other adventurers. Plentiful berries increase bear activity, so please keep an eye out and keep your distance. A good rule of thumb for wildlife encounters is truly a rule of thumb! With your arm outstretched, an animal should appear no bigger than the nail on your thumb. If it looks any larger, you are too close!</p><p>A couple weeks ago, Sunday River hosted the <strong>Tough Mountain Challenge</strong>! In the time after the challenge, our crews will be working to break down the course, and the obstacles may not be safe or secured, so please be careful. If you missed out this year, don&rsquo;t worry - next year's registration is <a href="https://runsignup.com/Race/ME/Newry/ToughMountainChallenge" target="_blank" rel="noopener">open now.</a>&nbsp;</p><p>Due to construction, be on the lookout for additional trail closure signage this week including North Peak and the bottom of the Spruce Triple.&nbsp;<strong>At times, foot travel between Barker and the top of the Chondola will not be permitted.</strong></p><p>If you are injured or need assistance at any point, please contact&nbsp;<strong>Patrol at (207)-824-5350</strong>&nbsp;or visit our First Aid Clinic in the bottom of the South Ridge Lodge next to Betty's Treats and Treasures.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
