<p><strong>February 6, 2022</strong></p><p>Ski through a sun-filled day on the slopes! Choose from any trail, as we start our Sunday with 100% open terrain. Close to 3 feet of snow covered all 8 peaks in the past week, making our 135 trails and glades absolutely stunning. Catch first chair at 8AM to carve your way across the mountain, or take powdery turns on natural terrain. Groomers put fresh corduroy on nearly 90 trails including White Heat, Vortex, 3D, and Airglow. Looking for those snow stashes between the trees? Explore almost 2,000 acres of our&nbsp; <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/boundary-to-boundary">boundary-to-boundary skiing</a> available to you.
