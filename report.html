Afternoon Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: January 19, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 1:23 PM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>It's a brisk one out there, but the turns are worth it. Just over half of our skiable terrain was groomed out, and the other half had some powder stashes left over from the storm. What a great way to start the weekend.&nbsp;</p><p>Our snowmaking team is planning on blowing snow on trails including T72, Obsession, and Snowbound, as well as resurfacing trails including American Express, Jungle Road, and Cascades. Our grooming team will be hitting our usual list of trails, with the new addition of Green Cheese, Moonstruck, Polaris, and Merrill Hill terrain. Lazy River and Broadway will also be groomed out after their recent resurfacing. The Little White Cap Quad will make its season debut tomorrow morning, and we're anticipating opening all trails on Merill Hill.&nbsp;</p><p>This weekend, book a single-night stay at the Jordan Hotel. This is a limited-time deal, so check it out before it disappears.
