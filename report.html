<h4><strong>February 25, 2023 | 1:30 PM</strong></h4><h4><strong style="font-size: 2em;">Afternoon Report</strong></h4><p>It was chilly up there today, but the fresh, groomed snow was terrific. Even around noon, trails were smooth and soft, gripping edges with ease without building up moguls. Besides a few trails closed for racing and events, ski patrol opened up the last of the runs, getting us as close as possible to 100% open for the day. Clouds stuck around, keeping it a little colder than desired, but visibility remained good and winds calm.</p><p>Tomorrow will finish off our weekend with cold temps in the teens again. Winds will be calm, clouds will be out, and there is even a chance for light snow fall by the middle of the day and into the afternoon. Our team will keep the snow guns off tonight. They will take to the slopes to groom our trails for another great day ahead.</p><p>If you don't use up all your energy exploring the mountain today, stick around for tonight to enjoy <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/presidents-week">twilight skiing, fireworks, live bands</a>, and multiple <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/resort-dining">dining</a> options around our resort.</p><p>See you next time!<br />-Team Snow</p><p></p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
