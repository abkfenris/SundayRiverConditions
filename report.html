<h4><strong>December 31, 2022 | 1:40 PM</strong></h4><h2><strong>Afternoon Update</strong><span></span></h2><p>We've truly experienced every kind of conditions over the past two weeks. We're ending 2022 with unseasonably warm temps, and a whole lot of fun skiing. The snow was like mashed potatoes, and temps stayed within the 40s all day. Skiers and riders took advantage of the weather and were out early. Decks, bars, and patios were filled with tired folks looking to take in the view and enjoy the warm weather.</p><p>Our Mountain Ops team will take to the slopes overnight, grooming what they deem necessary. All lifts and peaks will have at least one groomed trail to the bottom. However, not all trails will be groomed tonight in order to preserve the snowpack. More warm weather is on its way for the week, and our team is doing all it can to provide a great skiing experience while also doing what's best to maintain our base.</p><p>We hope you stick around this afternoon for <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/winter-activities/night-skiing">night skiing</a> until 8PM, <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/new-years-eve-kid-celebration">Black Diamond children's entertainment</a>, and <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/new-years-eve">fireworks</a> to celebrate the new year.
