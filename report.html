<h4><strong>April 1, 2023 | 1:15 PM</strong><strong></strong></h4><h4><strong style="font-size: 2em;">Afternoon Report</strong></h4><p>The rain has calmed and the cloudy fog is beginning to clear up. The snow is soft, smooth, and fun; we hear from the brave skiers and riders making their way in for lunch. Most went straight to Jordan for quick laps and coverage under the toasty bubble on the way up.</p><p>Groomers will hit the slopes early tomorrow morning, waiting on the ideal temps to groom out the snow. It should be a cloudy morning with temps in the high 20s. By mid-day, the sun should make its way out to soften up the trail's surface. We are noticing some high winds in our area in the morning. Please keep an eye on the mountain report for any lift status changes due to weather. Our Mountain Ops teams will do constant wind checks all over the resort while they begin to get the lifts running in the morning. Due to this, there is also a strong chance that uphill travel will not be allowed for the day tomorrow.</p><p>If you are sticking around for some afternoon laps today or heading up for a day of skiing tomorrow, don't forget to head to White Cap for <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/spring-fest-weekend.xml">Springfest</a> and party through the decades with us! Due to the weather, we'll be moving the party upstairs in White Cap lodge.&nbsp; We have a lot still going on here at Sunday River; as we wind down the season be sure to check out our <a href="sundayriver.com/spring">Spring operations schedule</a> and end-of-season<a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events"> events</a>.</p><p>See you out there!<br />-Team Snow</p><h4>A Note:</h4><p>Spring brings with it some of the best conditions of the year, but also the most variable condition. Please note that trail conditions may vary and change rapidly throughout the day.</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
