<p><strong>December 2, 2021</strong></p><p>December is already bringing us holiday cheer with a fresh dusting of snow and new terrain on Spruce Peak! Enjoy new snowmaking on Risky Business, and plenty of groomers topped with fresh snow from Mother Nature. We also made snow on Escapade, Lower Grand Rapids, Lower Down Draft, Sirius, Aludra, and Lights Out last night. Spruce Peak Triple, Locke Mountain Triple and South Ridge Express are also running from 9AM-3:45PM, and Barker Mountain Express remains closed. You can access Barker Mountain&rsquo;s terrain on-foot via Jungle Road from Upper Sunday Punch. Come celebrate all this snow with us today!</p><p>All lift tickets need to be&nbsp;<a href="https://shop.sundayriver.com/"><strong>purchased online in advance</strong></a>. Have your RFID from last year? You can head straight to the lift! Skier services are available in both the Barker and South Ridge Lodges, as well as shuttle service between these lodges and the hotels while the lifts spin. We are now accepting cashless forms of payment only.
