<h4><strong>January 22, 2023 | 1:44 PM</strong></h4><h2><strong>Afternoon Report</strong><span></span></h2><p>Well, folks, it's been a wonderful end to a true winter weekend. Cold temps this morning gave way to comfortable temps in the mid-20s. Friday's snow continues to provide everything from excellent corduroy to secret stashes. Mountain Ops will be back at it tonight, making snow and refreshing trails. We're excited to announce that snowmaking has begun on Merrill Hill, marking the first activity on that hill this season. Keep an eye out for announcements on opening!</p><p>In bigger news, we're tracking two storms, one tonight, and one later this week. While we're not ready to talk about Thursday yet, the storm tonight is looking promising for a wonderful refresh. After looking at all the models, we're confident that we are in a 4-6" band, with the potential for more. Some models even have us in 6-10", but we'll believe it when we see it. No matter what falls, the woods are in, and every flake on the mountain will continue to bolster our excellent conditions.</p><p>Tomorrow is the beginning of <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/senior-week">Senior Week</a>, where senior skiers and riders can take advantage of discounts, deals, and activities throughout the week. We hope you can make it up to the heart of western Maine soon, as the upcoming weather is starting to look very promising.</p><p>&nbsp;See you out there!<br />-Team Snow</p><p>&nbsp;</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
