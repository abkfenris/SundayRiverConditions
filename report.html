Morning Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: February 16, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 7:35 AM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>&nbsp;3 inches of snow to bring us into Presidents' Week? Thank you, Mother Nature. We have a solid 3 inches out there, and it's still coming down. We're looking at temperatures in the mid-twenties down in the base areas today, and temps in the mid- to high teens up top. Winds this morning should be light, and it might be a bit breezier by this afternoon. Be sure to check out below for the most updated lift and trail status.&nbsp;</p><p>Mountain Ops had a busy night last night. Our grooming team worked on Lazy River, Road Runner, and Lower Sunday Punch in addition to the usual trails. T2 and Monday Mourning also got a fresh groom last night, and while Monday Mourning will be closed for races today, T2 is open to the public. Tourist Trap is groomed from the bottom of the Spruce Triple to Outta Here, but the headwall remains ungroomed. Our snowmaking team also had a busy night last night, and they'll have an equally busy day today. The Tourist Trap headwall, Lollapalooza, Wildfire, Lower Downdraft, Broadway, and the lower sections of American Express and Grand Rapids all have active snowmaking today and will remain ungroomed.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/presidents-week" title="Presidents' Week | Sunday River, Maine">Presidents' Week</a> is here, and we're kicking it off with Red Bull's <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/winter-vibes" title="Red Bull Winter Vibes | Sunday River, Maine">Winter Vibes</a>.
