Afternoon Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: November 30, 2023 </strong></em><strong>| 12:54 PM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>And oh what a day it is. The sun is shining, temperatures have crept into the low 30s, and the snow is in mid-season form. The only thing that could make today any better is more terrain. Don't worry - we've got you covered.</p><p>The snowmaking team has been hard at work taking advantage of every cold snap and covering the mountain in snow. Thanks to their efforts, we're excited to announce that the South Ridge Base area will open for the season this Saturday. The Chondola and the South Ridge Express will both spin, and a whole heap of new trails are slated to come online. That will officially connect the Jordan Bowl to the rest of the resort, and offer trails off of 5 of our 8 peaks. We cannot wait to ski it all with you.</p><p>Until Saturday, please be aware that there is no terrain connecting Jordan Bowl and Locke Mountain and you will need to pick your peak. With the ongoing Barker 6 construction, parking will be very limited at Barker.</p><p>Lastly, here are some details to keep in mind before you go out and enjoy the day:</p><ul><li>Tonight is the last night of our <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/cyber-sale" title="Cyber Sale | Sunday River, Maine">Cyber Sale,</a> with deep discounts on lodging, lift tickets, ticket packs, and other deals. If you've been holding off planning your next favorite vacation, the time is now to lock it in and save.</li><li>In case you missed last week's announcement, keep December 9th open on your calendar.
