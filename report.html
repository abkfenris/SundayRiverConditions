<h4><strong>April 10, 2023 |&nbsp; 2:18 PM</strong><strong></strong></h4><h4><strong style="font-size: 2em;">Afternoon Report</strong></h4><p>Another terrific day of spring skiing in the books. There wasn't a cloud in the sky, and both the groomed and natural terrain were skiing like a dream. Looking ahead for the week, tomorrow and Wednesday look similar in temperature, but may have a bit more cloud cover. And we've probably all been eyeing up that Thursday-Saturday stretch where temps are forecasted to hit in the 70s. You know what that means, break out your party shirts and sunscreen because it's going to be a good time.</p><p>Please keep in mind that t<strong>here is no skiing access out of South Ridge.&nbsp;</strong>Please also note that the boundaries towards the White Cap side of the resort have changed due to closing terrain. Ski patrol has marked closed terrain, so if you see a rope, it's there for a reason. It's also worth mentioning that Ridge Run condo owners will have to head to Barker for chair access. Finally, Roadrunner is open, but for condo owners only.&nbsp;</p><p>As we wind down for the season be sure to check out our <a href="https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fclick.e.sundayriver.com%2F%3Fqs%3D3532f2a14112686f004c4d6db9936e36ccd25ab280453910571def6e065fe5af72430f4e68e0d57a37bc27ee15491331bde1be0271549030&amp;data=05%7C01%7Ccommunications%40sundayriver.com%7C8d93f7c7dd5043d02a4d08db376097a7%7C20fea68a11ec4b24a9055061d8e916d0%7C0%7C0%7C638164660220742442%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=oHsof1omnMs54vpYabTAQJCVYEzCG4%2F6U%2BD%2BtrpaO%2FY%3D&amp;reserved=0">Spring operations schedule</a> for all of the info on what lifts are spinning and when.</p><p>-Team Snow</p><h4>Mountain Notes:</h4><p>With the terrain closures, we <strong>only have green-level skiing out of the Jordan</strong> basin.</p><p>If you're looking to get over to Jordan from South Ridge, ski on over to Spruce Peak Triple and take Sirius &gt; Aludra &gt; Cyclone &gt; State Fair. Kansas will bring you back from Jordan to South Ridge when you're ready to head back East.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Spring brings with it some of the best conditions of the year, but also the most variable condition. Please note that trail conditions may vary and change rapidly throughout the day.</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
