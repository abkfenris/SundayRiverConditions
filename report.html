<h4><strong>February 2, 2023 | 7:30 AM</strong></h4><h4><strong style="font-size: 2em;">Morning Report</strong></h4><p>The sun is beginning to peak through the thin cloud coverage this morning, and all is quiet as we prepare the resort for another day. Active snowmaking fills the sky around us with snow clouds, putting a fresh dusting on our trails. Our grooming team hit the slopes shortly after last chair to pack our trails smooth and groom out those corduroy stripes we all look for. We are looking at over 800 acres of skiable terrain today, accessed by 13 lifts spread out along our eight peaks.</p><p>Today's weather looks similar to yesterday's, as temps will peak around the mid-20s in the middle of the day. The sun should peak through the clouds, and winds will remain reasonably calm. It's a great-looking day for skiing and riding here in western Maine. You might want to make the most of it, as we see a significant temperature drop in the next couple of days. If you are planning on making your way up to the mountain, pack extra layers and take a few extra breaks to warm up inside. These cold temps can be harsh, but the skiing is usually feels more rewarding!</p><p>&nbsp;See you at the top!<br />-Team Snow</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
