<p><strong>December 13, 2022 | 7:35 AM&nbsp;</strong></p><p>It's looking like another absolute stunner here up in Western Maine. The sunrise was particularly beautiful this morning, which we're choosing to take as a good omen of things to come. Short term, we're skiing and riding into another day of perfect corduroy on the most open terrain in New England thanks to our incredible groomers and snowmakers. Long term, Mother Nature may be finally ready to get in on the fun, but more to come on that later. Winds are slightly variable today, so as always, keep your eyes here for the latest info on lift and trail status.</p><p>We've also got some events coming down the pipeline this weekend with <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/winterfest-weekend">Winterfest Weekend</a>, this Saturday, December 17. All in all, this week is shaping up to be a darn good one. We'll see you out there!</p><p>-Team Snow</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
