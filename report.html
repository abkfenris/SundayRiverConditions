<h4><strong>January 25, 2023 | 7:35 AM</strong></h4><h2><strong>Morning Report</strong><span></span></h2><p>Happy Wednesday, today is National Observe the Weather Day, which for us here in Western Maine is especially relevant. We are looking at a third storm in recent days coming through our area, starting as early as 4 PM this afternoon. Temps before this will be in the low twenties, and clouds will surely fill the sky above. These temps do seem to increase as the night goes on and into Thursday; we are all observing these temps to see what snow quality this incoming storm will bring us.</p><p>Today, however will be a great day of skiing and riding in moderate temperatures, low winds, and fast, smooth trails. Our Mountain Ops team was back to work last night and early this morning, grooming out trails and redrawing stripes back down the mountain. They began the shift on their usual beginner and intermediate trails, getting those prepped for this morning. Once completed, they headed to Vortex and groom it from top to bottom. The rest of the team made their way to White Heat to work the large amount of snow on that trail and prepare it to reopen in the upcoming days. Snowmaking was on throughout the night and will remain on as long as possible today until temps no longer allow.&nbsp;</p><p>With a second grooming of this fresh new snow, the conditions are sure to be excellent, as this soft corduroy will easily hold an edge. Let's hope we can get a great result from this incoming storm tonight to add to the fun out there. Winter is back in Western Maine, and the skiing is superb!&nbsp;</p><p>See you out there!<br />-Team Snow</p><p></p><p></p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
