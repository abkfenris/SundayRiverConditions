<h4><strong>February 26, 2023 | 1:30 PM</strong></h4><h4><strong style="font-size: 2em;">Afternoon Report</strong></h4><p>Good afternoon Sunday River shredders. Mother nature has treated us this afternoon with fresh falling snow on top of some beautiful soft groomed trails. It won't be a whole lot of snow, just an inch or two maybe, but we will take it. The temps were certainly chilly out there, but the trail quality was fantastic and made it a great day to be out on the slopes.&nbsp;</p><p>As we wrap up presidents' week, our lift schedule returns to normal for the mid-week, running lifts from 9AM-4PM and shutting down Locke, Merrill Hill and North Peak liftsduring the week days again. Our groomers will take to the mountain after last chair this afternoon to redraw those perfect stripes onto the trails and smooth out the terrain. The weather will be reasonably cold again tomorrow, with temps ranging from 10-30 degrees. Wind should remain calm, and some clouds will fill the skies throughout the day. We hope for some more natural snow in the coming week to add another fresh layer to our surface and continue building our base. Until then, take some time for yourself to come get in a few laps on some beautiful soft corduroy groomers here in western Maine.&nbsp;</p><p>See you next time!<br />-Team Snow</p><p></p><h3><strong>A Note:</strong></h3><p>We love that our guests are exploring new terrain while enjoying the beautiful views and spectacular homes on Merrill Hill and The Glades. With that in mind, we ask that all guests be respectful of the private property directly adjacent to groomed surfaces by avoiding venturing off trail and staying within the boundary lines of the resort. Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
