Afternoon Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: April 15, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 2:01 PM</strong></h5><p>Another beautiful spring day in the books. Creamy turns, a light breeze, and the sun started to poke its way through the clouds. Today felt like a great way to wrap up our midweek days of operation.</p><p>Going forward, <strong>we'll be open weekends only</strong>. We'll be closed tomorrow April 16-April 19 and will <strong>reopen April 20-21</strong> with 8AM starts for the weekend. Today is also the last day for Barker 6 and Spruce. The final days of skiing for the 2023-24 season will happen out of the Jordan basin. Coverage is still looking pretty good over there, so we're hoping we'll be able to keep some naturals in play for next weekend.</p><p>Last piece of info for all you skiers and riders is while we are closed midweek, all uphill routes will also be closed. Our mountain ops teams have begun their teardown process across the mountain and do anticipate utilizing heavy machinery during our midweek closure.</p><p>For additional information for spring operations, please visit our <a href="/spring">Spring Schedule</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>We will see you out there!</p><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">- Team Snow</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
