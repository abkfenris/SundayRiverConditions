</p><p style="color: #696969; font-weight: 900; font-size: 12px;">WEDNESDAY, MARCH 3</p><div><p><strong>6:30AM Update: </strong>Due to yesterday's significant wind, we lost power across the resort. As of this morning, power is partially restored and the team is working to opening Chondola, South Ridge Express, Sundance Surface Lifts, White Heat, and Little White Cap for 9AM and plan to add more throughout the day. Please make your plans to ski out of South Ridge or White Cap base lodges, as Barker Lodge does not have power.&nbsp;</p><p>Uphill travel is closed today.</p><p><span>While our lift team working hard, our groomers also put in the work overnight to transform the snow into beautiful corduroy. Looking ahead, we're expecting sunshine on the slopes later in the week and into the weekend, and our grooming team will be out nightly across the mountain. March always brings us the best sunshine and some snowy surprises. It&rsquo;s never too early to start planning your next <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/resort-lodging">weekend getaway</a>.</span></p><p><span>If you get hungry while on the slopes we have multiple indoor and outdoor&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/river-guide" style="text-decoration-line: underline; color: #9685ba;">dining options</a><span>&nbsp;available this winter, including the ability to order online for select venues</span><span>.</span><span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p><p>We&nbsp;<a title="Online Store" href="https://shop.sundayriver.com/s/lift-tickets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">require online purchase of lift tickets</a>&nbsp;and limit&nbsp;the number of tickets<span>&nbsp;sold for each day. This includes full-day, beginner, Threedom additional days, and Passholder Friend tickets. We only expect these limits to affect peak dates, but encourage everyone to buy early to ensure access on the dates you want. Season passes, Ikon passes, and lift ticket packs remain direct-to-lift with no restrictions or reservations.</span></p><p><span>Fast and contactless lift ticket pickup is available at our PUBs (Pick Up Boxes) at base lodges and hotels. Just scan the barcode at the bottom of your confirmation email and your RFID cards will print with your lift tickets or ticket packs loaded. For best results turn off dark mode on your phone if you use it and avoid email apps that use dark backgrounds.</span></p><p><span>Please remember to take a self-administered </span><a title="Health Screening" href="https://www.sundayriver.com/covid">Health Screening</a><span> and visit our&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/covid">COVID Winter Guide</a><span>&nbsp;before each trip to stay up-to-date on safety protocols and state guidelines.</span></p><p><span>Masks up!</span></p><p><span>Team Snow</span></p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
