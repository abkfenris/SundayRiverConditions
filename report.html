<h4><strong>December 17, 2022 |8:00 AM&nbsp;</strong></h4><p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: <strong>POWER ISSUES&nbsp;</strong><br />We are currently experiencing power issues. Due to this, we will only be running the three surface lifts, the Chondola, and the Alera Group Competition T-bar at Locke for the morning. <br />We will update you with our lift statuses as soon as our power problem is solved.</p><h2><strong>Morning Report</strong></h2><p>It's a snow globe out there, and it finally feels like winter. The weatherman estimated 10-14" of snow by this morning, and after digging out the car, there is at least that. Luckily it's the weekend, so you won't have to call out of work, but you might want to cancel your lunch plans with the missus; this snow is not stopping soon. The snow is light and fluffy here at the base, the winds are calm, and temps will be comfortable, sitting around the high 20s - 30s throughout the day.</p><p>Mountain Ops will be out there this morning digging out the lifts plowing parking lots, and grooming out beginner terrain at South Ridge in preparation for your arrival. Ski Patrol will be looking to open a few new trails as the snow continues to fall, so look out for some dropping ropes throughout the day to get the best freshies. This is the storm we have been waiting for to create that solid base for the season and bring the winter spirit back to the mountain. Drive safe out there today, and don't forget to stick around tonight for the kick-off of <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/winterfest-weekend">Winterfest!</a></p><p>&nbsp;See you in the powder!<br />-Team Snow</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
