Morning Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: February 2, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 7:32 AM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>Today will bring us partly cloudy skies, temps in the high twenties to high thirties, light and variable winds, and a chance of flurries. To start the weekend off, we have over 825 acres of open terrain and 13 lifts.&nbsp;</p><p>Our grooming team laid some corduroy on Bear Paw last night, so check that out for first tracks of the season. They cleaned up our usual list of terrain, including all our beginner terrain, most of our intermediate terrain, and our classic advanced terrain like Right Stuff, Airglow, and Obsession. Broadway rejoins our list of groomed terrain today, as well. Our snowmaking team took care of some maintenance last night in response to the warmer temps, but those temps will drop back down tonight, and they'll be ready.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/pride-weekend" title="Pride Weekend | Sunday River, Maine">Pride Weekend</a> starts today, and there are events for everyone to enjoy.
