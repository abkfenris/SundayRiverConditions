<p><strong>December 11, 2022 | 6:35AM</strong></p><p>Good morning and happy Sunday; the winter temps have arrived. During the night, Snow guns were blasting throughout the resort to push our terrain expansion and give the groomers some new snow to move around this morning. The team was able to buff out all of the trails that had active snowmaking yesterday and draw new lines on the rest of the open trails we have to offer. Snowmaking will be present today on Spruce Peak and Parts of Locke Mountain until temps no longer allow us to create snow.</p><p>It looks like winter is finally here as temps begin to drop today. Some possible clouds this morning, and temperatures will range between 15 and 30 degrees. Please be cautious when skiing trails for the first time, as mixed conditions may be present. Always be aware of others around you as we begin to see more skiers and riders joining us on the hill. Don't forget to head to South Ridge this morning to witness the <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/santa-sunday">Santa Sunday</a> spectacle to kick off your holiday season.</p><p>It's going to be another beautiful Sunday here in the heart of western Maine, so why not spend it here at Sunday River.</p><p>&nbsp;-Team Snow</p><p></p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
