<p><strong>December 5, 2022 | 7:35 AM</strong></p><p>We probably sound like a broken record at this point, but our snowmakers are wicked good. Temps in the teens last night allowed the team to really get after it, and the snowmaking cloud on the mountain is nothing short of astounding. We'll be turning off the guns throughout the morning as temps rise, but please note, South Ridge will be ungroomed today. As such, there is&nbsp;<strong>no beginner terrain</strong> currently available. Outside of the South Ridge basin, cats were on the prowl last night, laying down perfect stripes across all remaining open terrain. The sun is shining, temps are expected to peak in the mid-30s, and winds are calm, meaning this is shaping up to be on heck of a day on the slopes.&nbsp;</p><p>We'll see you out there!</p><p>-Team Snow</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
