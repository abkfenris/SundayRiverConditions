Morning Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: February 18, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 6:35 AM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>Temperatures are currently in the single digits across the mountain, and they're forecasted to rise to low twenties up top and mid-twenties in the base areas. Winds are variable, and the snow is fast. We're looking at over 710 acres of open terrain across the mountain, with 19 lifts scheduled to spin for today. Check out the lift and trail status below for the most up-to-date information.&nbsp;</p><p>Our grooming team put down corduroy on 82 trails last night. Wildfire got its first groom of the season, and the new manmade snow on White Heat, Paradigm, and Upper Vortex was worked into stripes. White Heat will be the trail of the morning, so be sure to head that way for first chair. If White Heat isn't up your alley, get first tracks on American Express, Lollapalooza, or Green Cheese for some relaxed cruisers. Our snowmaking team was off the hill last night, and they'll be back in action Tuesday night.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/presidents-week" title="Presidents' Week | Sunday River, Maine">Presidents' Week</a> is here, and we have a whole host of events.
