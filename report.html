Operations Update</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: December 21, 2023 </strong></em><strong>| 4:50 PM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p><span>Despite the significant impact of this storm on our state, it hasn't stopped Mainers from doing what they do best &ndash; rolling up their sleeves and getting the job done. Our heartfelt appreciation goes out to our dedicated line workers, first responders, and various state agencies for their collaborative efforts in restoring Maine. </span></p><p><span>We also want to recognize some of our own heroes. Despite facing power outages in their own homes, our lodging teams have gone above and beyond to ensure our guests are well taken care of. Simultaneously, our Food and Beverage teams have worked tirelessly to provide food for our team members and contractors. Their undeterred spirit and commitment is what makes our community shine, and we are fortunate to share these wins that bring us together. </span></p><p><span></span><span></span><span>Significant restoration progress has been made, including the installation of a temporary bridge at the Grand Summit. Our dedicated teams are working around the clock repairing road washouts, replacing culverts, and clearing debris from base areas. While ongoing construction remains across the resort, we kindly urge guests and the public to avoid the mountain and any areas affected by washouts. Currently, all trails, including uphill access, are closed.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span></span><span>We are excited to confirm that we will be back skiing and riding this Saturday at 8AM. Lift access will be out of the Barker Basin with the&nbsp;</span><span>Barker 6,&nbsp;</span><span> Locke Triple, and Spruce Triple accessing advanced terrain only. Barker Lodge will be open for all services, including dining out of the cafeteria and the Barker Bar. South Ridge will not have ski access, but the Sunday River Sports flagship store will be open for last-minute Christmas shopping, and the Foggy Goggle will be open for lunch, dinner, and drinks.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Access on December 23 and 24 will be limited to season passholders, ticket pack holders, Ikon passholders, and guests with pre-purchased lift tickets. For those staying directly at the Grand Summit, Jordan, or Snow Cap Inn through the resort, Stay &amp; Save lift tickets will be available for purchase during your stay.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Please keep in mind, while we are excited to welcome guests back to the slopes, Bethel and the surrounding area is still recovering from the storm. Limited services will be available both in town and on the mountain. Please plan accordingly. </span></p><p><span></span><span>Both the grooming and snowmaking teams are gearing up for a busy night on the slopes as further preparation continues. </span><span></span><span>As always, please continue to check the Mountain Report for future operational updates.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span></span><span>We can't wait to welcome you back.</span></p><p><span></span><span></span><span>- Team Snow</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
