Morning Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: November 19, 2023 </strong></em><strong>| 6:30 AM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>Wow, what a weekend! Despite the brief weather shake ups, it has been an awesome first weekend. Our Mountain Operations Team, our snowmakers, and our groomers have been putting in the work, as they always do, and it showed out on the trails. If you haven't been up yet, what are you waiting for?&nbsp;</p><p>Last night, the grooming team put fresh stripes on Lollapalooza, Boots On, Boots Off, and Grand Ave for another day on the slopes. Rogue Angel saw a lot of love yesterday, and right now is scheduled to open. But, keep an eye out on the Mountain Report for further updates on its status. Snowmakers last night took advantage of the cold temps, and focused on&nbsp; Jordan and parts of Oz, while also working on expanding terrain offerings across Locke and Barker. As soon as the temps hit that magic number more consistently, all efforts will shift towards expansion.</p><p>For those needing ticket assistance, a Guest Service station is located in the bottom terminal of the Jordan 8. All Ikon Pass holders who need assistance must visit the Welcome Center in the South Ridge Base Lodge.</p><p>Please note that early-season, variable terrain will be present on all trails. Lastly, don't forget to check out our <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/early-season" title="Early Season Guide | Sunday River, Maine">Early Season Guide</a>.</p><p><span>Locke Mountain will continue to serve as the resort's dedicated early-season training venue for our partners Gould Academy and Bates College, as well as for pre-booked ski teams only. All public access to snow surfaces will be through the Jordan Bowl.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Please note that as crews work to expand the resort, all uphill travel is prohibited. The current <a href="/mountain-report#uphill_status">Uphill Route Status</a> can be found at the bottom of the Mountain Report. Also, all construction areas remain off-limits. Thank you in advance for allowing our crews the space to safely expand our terrain and complete the last steps of exciting new projects.</span></p><p>As always, keep an eye here for the latest info on our lift and trail status, as well as any other operational updates.</p><p>Think cold!</p><p>- Team Snow</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
