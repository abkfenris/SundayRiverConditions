</p><p style="color: #696969; font-weight: 900; font-size: 12px;">TUESDAY, MARCH 30</p><p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="color: #333333;">Rise and shine! The sun is out and the slopes are ready for a morning of carving and an afternoon of slashing up spring snow. Start the morning enjoying corduroy on trails like American Express, Escapade, Lazy River, and Cascades. Let the sunshine soften the ungroomed trails early, then have some fun on the bumps. It is a gorgeous day on the mountain today and even if you have to work we highly suggest taking an extra-long lunch break for afternoon laps. Lifts will start spinning at 9AM. <o:p></o:p></span></p><p><a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/resort-lodging">One-night stays are now available</a> Saturday at the Grand Summit and Jordan Hotel, so plan a quick springtime getaway for a weekend of skiing in the sunshine.&nbsp;</p><div><p>With operations open daily through April 24, there is plenty of ski season ahead.
