Afternoon Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: March 8, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 2:01 PM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>Not a cloud in sight out there, with blue skies for miles. The snow is soft and the sun is shining, and if you didn't already have a goggle tan before today, you sure do now. Ski until last chair, and then head to one of the slopeside decks for some apr<span>&egrave;</span>s in the sun. Get it while you can, because temps are supposed to drop tonight and tomorrow.&nbsp;</p><p>More news that we've all been hoping for: it seems like Mother Nature is going to give us a helping hand, and we're expecting several inches of snow Sunday into Monday. Some snow maps predict over a foot, so keep your fingers crossed. Think cold, and think snow.&nbsp;</p><p>Our snowmaking team has another temperature window tonight, and they'll be making snow in several different locations across the resort. The snow guns will turn off at 8AM tomorrow, and after that, they'll be back on Monday night through the end of next week. We have a dedicated snowmaking team, and they're ready to go. Our grooming team will add Merrill Hill back to the list of groomed terrain, as well as other trails like Ridge Run and Moonstruck.&nbsp;</p><p>We have twilight skiing tonight out of South Ridge, so stay late and ski under the lights. Catch James Rice at the Foggy Goggle from 3-6PM tonight, or head over to Shipyard to see Dos Devils from 5-8PM. We have more live music tomorrow, including a live DJ at the Alpeniglu all day. <span>Be sure to check out our <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/apres-and-nightlife" title="Apres and Nightlife | Sunday River, Maine">Apr&egrave;s &amp; Nightlife</a> schedule for a full list of live music across the mountain.
