<h4><strong>January 2, 2023 | 7:25 AM&nbsp;</strong></h4><h2><strong>Morning Update</strong><span></span></h2><p><span>They say &ldquo;no news is good news&rdquo;, but maybe not in this case. Nothing new means that temps will continue to stay warm, snowmaking ability will be limited, and adding new terrain will remain challenging. Over the course of this season, New England has been plagued with warm temperatures and rain that have prevented us from expanding terrain the way we can. While the spring conditions have been top-notch and insanely fun, they&rsquo;re not really what you want to see in January. But even though we aren&rsquo;t necessarily jumping for joy at the present state of things, our Mountain Ops teams has consistently kept us at the top of the list for open terrain across New England, and that is something to be psyched about.</span><br /><br /><span>The short-range forecast isn&rsquo;t looking too great, but as we all know, weather can change on a dime. There is, however, some light at the end of the tunnel with temps cooling off toward the end of the week that will let our snowmaking crew really put the throttle down and make some more magic. Speaking of magic, the snowmakers took to the hill last night and were able to run some guns across the resort. You may encounter active snowmaking as temperatures allow in the Jordan area, so be advised about that. The groomers also laid down some cord and were able to touch up some of the runs that hadn't been groomed the night before.</span></p><p>All in all, things are looking pretty sweet.</p><p>&nbsp;-Team Snow</p><p><b>UPDATED Uphill Policy</b><span>: Uphill travel is NOT</span><span>&nbsp;permitted until further notice.&nbsp;</span></p><p></p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
