<p><strong>February 8, 2022</strong></p><p>Mother Nature has brought us 5" more across all 8 peaks! Catch first chair flurries at 9AM and ski our topped off trails. In less than two weeks we've had over 3 feet of snow cover our terrain, making 134 open glades and trails beautiful. Large flakes are falling on the slopes to make for great conditions as we ski into this afternoon. Groomers put down stripes on almost 90 trails last night, and are making fresh corduroy this morning on terrain across South Ridge and more for you to carve this morning. Take your turns between the trees with nearly 2,000 acres of options including our <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/boundary-to-boundary">boundary-to-boundary skiing</a> for you to explore. As the snowy system rolls out of town later this afternoon, we could expect some winds to impact lifts before last chair. Please check the lift and trail status as we keep you updated while the flurries fly. Ski 23" of new snow just from this past week, with more coming down!</p><p><strong>Around the Resort</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/presidents-week.xml">Presidents' Week</a> is less than two weeks away!
