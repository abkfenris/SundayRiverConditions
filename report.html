<strong>Lift tickets are sold out for Saturday and Sunday.</strong></p><p style="color: #696969; font-weight: 900; font-size: 12px;">SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 13</p><div><p>Yesterday we were enjoying endless mountain views, 80+ beautiful groomers, and were still exploring in the glades. The best part? We get to do it all over again today. Kick off Presidents' Week by hopping on first chair at 8AM and making your way across all eight peaks. Our groomers hit the slopes overnight on their normal routes, but added some stripes on Quantum Leap and Black Hole. For some fast carving, head to trails like Risky Business, Right Stuff, and Rogue Angel. If you're looking to bop through the trees, head over to Jordan Bowl. For those who are just learning, stick to the terrain on South Ridge and off of the Little White Cap Quad. There's a lot to enjoy out there and you can continue to ski or ride tonight until 6:30PM with <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/winter-activities/night-skiing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twilight Skiing</a>. End your night on the slopes with a fireworks show at 7PM at South Ridge.&nbsp;</p><p style="font-style: inherit;">We have quite the line-up for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/presidents-week">Presidents&rsquo; Week</a> with twilight skiing every night, fireworks, and<a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/valentines-day"> Valentine&rsquo;s Day specials</a>.
