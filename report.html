</h6><p style="color: #696969; font-weight: 900; font-size: 12px;">MONDAY, JANUARY 18</p><p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="color: #333333;">Happy Monday at the mountain! With a storm that brought us 6-9&rdquo; of new snow this weekend, the mountain is looking pretty spectacular. Not only that but more importantly it is skiing and riding even better. The groomers hit the slopes last night to press out the snow for stunning soft and carvey corduroy today. Enjoy open terrain on all eight peaks. If you&rsquo;re just learning, start the day at South Ridge for the best learning terrain, or if you&rsquo;re staying at the Grand Summit Hotel, White Cap has great green terrain off of Little White Cap Quad.</span></p><p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="color: #333333;"><o:p></o:p></span><span style="color: #333333;">Lifts start spinning at 8AM today. If you&rsquo;re wondering where the beloved red cabins are, in preparation for this past weekend&rsquo;s storm, our team removed the cabins off of the Chondola to help avoid any wind holds. Even though we had a storm bring us nearly a foot of snow, there is no such thing as too much snow for snowmakers. Tonight they plan to head back out on the mountain and fire up the snow guns as they continue to work their magic.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p><p>Please note that we are experiencing high call volume in our call center.
