Mother Nature wasn't done with winter and rolled through yesterday with some April snow showers. Groomers reported up to 6" of new snow up top and it's been a fun day out there in a winter wonderland. This weekend, enjoy skiing or riding on terrain off of Barker and Spruce, with lifts spinning at 8AM. Keep it up until last chair at 4PM and continue bopping around in the fresh snow. We'll see you at first chair tomorrow.&nbsp;</span></p><p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline;"><span color="#333333" style="color: #333333;">All&nbsp;</span><span color="#333333" style="color: #333333;">skier services and food options are available at Barker Lodge.
