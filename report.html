<h4><strong>January 28, 2023 | 1:30 PM</strong></h4><h4><strong style="font-size: 2em;">Afternoon Report</strong></h4><p>A few hours of surprise snow flurries kicked off the morning. Groomed trails were smooth, fast, and gripped edges with ease. Only the most adventurous headed off trail and into the woods to see how the conditions were. More skied-off areas had broken up sections that softened up as the day went on. However, most untouched snow is still crusted over by a thick frozen section and was found difficult by most to maneuver on. By midday, the sun came out, and all was beautiful. Temperatures began to rise, and the snow surface softened up even more. Merrill Hill had its opening day today, providing access to beautiful views and winding beginner terrain.</p><p>Going into the night, the snowguns will remain on, and snowcats will hit the slopes full force grooming out the mountain as usual and preparing it for another great day tomorrow. The weather tomorrow looks similar, as temperatures will reach the low 30s. Clouds will pass by throughout the day, possibly even bringing a few snow showers early on. As January wraps up, we are finally starting to feel like it's winter here in Western Maine, and we hope you can join us on the slopes soon.</p><p>&nbsp;See you out there!<br />-Team Snow</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
