<h4><strong>December 19, 2022 | 7:25 AM</strong></h4><h2><strong>Morning Report</strong></h2><p>Good morning folks, and welcome to another excellent week of skiing and riding. The grooming team took to the hill last night and worked their magic, taking advantage of this recent snowfall to deliver stripes of true hero snow. Our snowmakers were also back at it, firing guns across Aurora and Jordan and continuing our march west. Thanks to the efforts of patrol, and all of this new snow, we are starting the day with nearly 400 acres. Not bad for the middle of December.</p><p>Today's weather is expected to be mild, with highs hitting the low 30s. Wind will be present throughout the day, especially in the higher peaks. Keep an eye on the mountain report throughout the day if you start feeling some stronger gusts.&nbsp;</p><p>Winter has only just begun!</p><p>-Team Snow</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
