Mountain Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: January 16, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 7:42 AM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>Bundle up folks, it's a chilly one out there today. South Ridge temperatures are hovering right around the 10-degree mark, and are expected to crest in the low 20s this afternoon. Winds are expected to be minimal throughout the morning, but may pick-up as our next storm system approaches. That's right, more snow is in today's forecast after nearly <strong>3 feet</strong> of snow in the past week.</p><p>For today, we're expecting to have a similar host of trails for your carving delight. The grooming team continues to work in all this fresh snow, providing 50 groomed trails across the peaks.&nbsp;</p><p>Snowmaking is also having an incredibly productive stretch thanks to these prolonged cold temps. T72 and Ridge Run are getting a bunch of love as we work towards opening those trails, and we have also begun the process of burying White Cap. With the forecast looking the way it is, stay tuned for more trail openings soon.</p><p>For tonight, we're expecting yet another snowstorm to move into the area. NOAA has most of the region in 6-8" of light fluffy snow to fall throughout the afternoon and evening. Whoever is doing their snow dances, please don't stop.</p><p>Have you always wished you could ride ina snow cat?
