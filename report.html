<p><strong>November 22, 2022 | 2:05 PM</strong></p><p>Another beautiful day of skiing and riding under bluebird skies today. Our groomers will be out and about tonight laying down fresh corduroy on Cascades, Sunday Punch, Jim's Whim, Ecstasy, Jungle Road, and Right Stuff. What better way to stretch out your legs before Turkey Day than on top to bottom corduroy?
