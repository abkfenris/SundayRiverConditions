Morning Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: February 7, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 7:32 AM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>Good morning, Sunday River. Today, we're looking at temperatures in the mid-twenties, mostly sunny skies, and light winds. We have 13 lifts scheduled for 820 acres of open terrain.&nbsp;</p><p>Our grooming team was hard at work on the hill last night, laying stripes on over half of our open terrain. White Heat will open as a groomed trail today for the first time this season, and a groomed Salvation will make its season debut today. Our standard list of trails were also groomed out, including the majority of our beginner and intermediate terrain. Our snowmaking team continued to resurface terrain last night. Please note that there will be active snowmaking on Borealis, Vortex, Airglow, and Rogue Angel. Those trails will also remain ungroomed.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/presidents-week" title="Presidents' Week | Sunday River, Maine">Presidents' Week</a> will be here before we know it, and we have events planned for the whole family.
