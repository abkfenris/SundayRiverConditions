<h5>December 20, 2021</h5><ul></ul><p>The sun is shining on over 300 acres of open terrain and almost 50 groomed trails for you to carve today! The recent system brought us 6-10" of fresh powder, and we are looking forward to a beautiful day on the mountain. Temperatures are ideal for blasting guns across the resort, and Mother Nature may even make another appearance next weekend to ring in the holidays. What better way to count down to Christmas, than with a lot of open terrain!</p><p>Since Jordan Bowl is open, both hotels are now ski-in/ski-out access for your convenience. Please note our only beginner terrain is available within the South Ridge Express Quad at this time. With this in mind, skiing into the Grand Summit Hotel is currently accessible via blue terrain. Rental snowboards are now back in stock. Have a great day skiing the snowy slopes!</p><p><strong>Around the Resort</strong></p><p>Recently opened for the season, Sliders Restaurant is conveniently located off Lollapalooza and inside the Jordan Hotel. The Mountain Room has also opened, located within Peak Lodge. For retail needs head over to Sunday River Sports, Betty's Treats and Treasures, or unwind at the Jordan Spa.</p><p>For the latest updates whenever you visit us, head to the <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/river-guide">River Guide</a>.</p><p>-Team Snow</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
