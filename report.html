<p><strong>December 4, 2022 | 1:05 PM</strong></p><p>Good afternoon! As the wind calmed, our lift crew gave the all-clear to spin the lifts we had on hold this morning, allowing for some great turns for the afternoon. Overnight, our crew will be hard at work once again, grooming open trails and blowing more snow in preparation for expanding terrain. As for tomorrow, the sun should be out with calm winds by the time the lifts start spinning, creating another great day of bright skies and fast groomers. Please be aware and take caution that some open trails tomorrow will have active snowmaking on them.</p><p>Looking ahead, we're expecting more unsettled weather, so tomorrow definitely looks like the day to get your turns in.&nbsp;</p><p>We'll see you out there!</p><p>-Team Snow</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
