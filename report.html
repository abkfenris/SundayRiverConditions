<h4><strong>April 10, 2023 |&nbsp; 7:35 AM</strong><strong></strong></h4><h4><strong style="font-size: 2em;">Morning Report</strong></h4><p>Good morning everyone, we hope you enjoyed your Easter celebrations yesterday and are able to get up here to work off that candy the Easter bunny left behind. Today we've got some lovely weather on tap. Temps currently are hovering around 30 but are expected to climb throughout the day with some bright sun and blue sky. Grooming did their thing last night, hitting all the usual suspects. Conditions should be a little firm, but quickly soften up as the day progresses.</p><p>Today we are operating Barker, Spruce, and Jordan for chairs. <strong>There is no skiing access out of South Ridge.&nbsp;</strong>Please also note that the boundaries towards the White Cap side of the resort have changed due to closing terrain. Ski patrol has marked closed terrain, so if you see a rope, it's there for a reason.&nbsp;It's also worth noting that Ridge Run condo owners will have to head to Barker for chair access. Finally, Roadrunner is open, but for condo owners only.&nbsp;</p><p>As we wind down for the season be sure to check out our <a href="https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fclick.e.sundayriver.com%2F%3Fqs%3D3532f2a14112686f004c4d6db9936e36ccd25ab280453910571def6e065fe5af72430f4e68e0d57a37bc27ee15491331bde1be0271549030&amp;data=05%7C01%7Ccommunications%40sundayriver.com%7C8d93f7c7dd5043d02a4d08db376097a7%7C20fea68a11ec4b24a9055061d8e916d0%7C0%7C0%7C638164660220742442%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=oHsof1omnMs54vpYabTAQJCVYEzCG4%2F6U%2BD%2BtrpaO%2FY%3D&amp;reserved=0">Spring operations schedule</a> for all of the info on what lifts are spinning and when.</p><p>-Team Snow</p><h4>Mountain Notes:</h4><p>With the terrain closures, we <strong>only have green-level skiing out of the Jordan</strong> basin.</p><p>If you're looking to get over to Jordan from South Ridge, ski on over to Spruce Peak Triple and take Sirius &gt; Aludra &gt; Cyclone &gt; State Fair. Kansas will bring you back from Jordan to South Ridge when you're ready to head back East.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Spring brings with it some of the best conditions of the year, but also the most variable condition. Please note that trail conditions may vary and change rapidly throughout the day.</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
