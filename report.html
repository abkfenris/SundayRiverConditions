<h4><strong>February 14, 2023 | 12:45 PM</strong></h4><h4><strong style="font-size: 2em;">Afternoon Report</strong></h4><p>It's been an excellent Tuesday on the mountain. Flurries persisted throughout the day, reminding us that it is very much still winter in Western Maine. All groomed terrain is skiing exceptionally well, with the soft snow working its way into our existing base.&nbsp;</p><p>Snowmaking will be back on the slopes this evening, continuing to take advantage of every window they can. The grooming team will also be back at it tonight, pressing fresh stripes into all of their standard trails.&nbsp;</p><p>In the world of Terrain Parks, Wonderland will receive a rebuild this evening, with terrain-based learning being built in place of the boxes. Those features will move over to Who-ville tonight.</p><p>Wednesday and Thursday are both looking like phenomenal days to call out sick, with unseasonably warm temps making for nice soft turns.&nbsp;</p><p>Lastly, <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/booklodging" title="Book Lodging | Sunday River">one-night stays</a> are now available for Presidents' Week. All properties, all week, grab yours before they're gone!</p><p>We'll see you out there!</p><p>-Team Snow</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
