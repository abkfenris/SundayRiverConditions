<p><strong>February 3, 2022</strong></p><p>We'll be straight with you: today is bringing us soft snow, grey skies, and a chance of drizzle with temperatures in the 30s. But it's all expected to turn a corner tonight with forecasts calling for a foot of snow overnight into Friday morning. Until then, grab your Gore-Tex layers, enjoy some smooth and buttery turns on over 800 acres of skiable terrain, and get ready for yet another powder day. The grooming team spent the evening putting stripes on 81 trails, and there are still goods in the woods from last weekend's 14" of snow.&nbsp;</p><p>Please note that ski-in access to the Jordan Hotel requires the navigation of intermediate trails to reach Jordan Bowl.</p><p><strong>Around the Resort</strong></p><p>OutRyders is partnering with Sunday River to bring you <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/pride-weekend.xml" title="event listing">Pride Weekend</a> this February 4-6!
