<h4><strong>February 27, 2023 | 2:15 AM</strong></h4><h4><strong style="font-size: 2em;">Afternoon Report</strong></h4><p>Well, folks, that was a pretty darn good day. The snow was soft and carvable and the sun stayed out all day with just a few whispy clouds overhead. Looking ahead, tomorrow is looking snowy. We're poised to pick up several inches throughout the day, so get ready for free refills!&nbsp;</p><p>We'll see you tomorrow for another day of skiing and riding.</p><p>Think snowy thoughts!<br />-Team Snow</p><p></p><h3><strong>A Note:</strong></h3><p>We love that our guests are exploring new terrain while enjoying the beautiful views and spectacular homes on Merrill Hill and The Glades. With that in mind, we ask that all guests be respectful of the private property directly adjacent to groomed surfaces by avoiding venturing off trail and staying within the boundary lines of the resort. Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
