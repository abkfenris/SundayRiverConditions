Morning Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: January 4, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 7:43 AM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>Today the Aurora Quad will join our lineup of lifts, making for 10 lifts, 37 trails, and 255 acres of groomed terrain. We're looking at temperatures in the mid-thirties this morning, although they'll fall throughout the afternoon and stay cold for the next few days. Cross your fingers: we might have some frozen precipitation on the horizon.</p><p>Our grooming team hit all open terrain last night, and Excalibur joins the list of groomed trails. The corduroy is fresh and the snow should be firm. Our snowmaking team was out and about last night, blowing snow over on Aurora. Keep an eye out for new terrain in the coming days. We also opened the uphill route on Jordan this morning, so slap on those skins and get after it.&nbsp;</p><p>This weekend, check out <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/indie-demo-day" title="Indie Demo Day | Sunday River, Maine">Indie Demo Day</a>, where you'll have the chance to demo some of the top independent ski and snowboard brands.
