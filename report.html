<h4><strong>March 1, 2023 | 7:30 AM</strong></h4><h4><strong style="font-size: 2em;">Morning Report</strong></h4><p>Western Maine is starting March off strong with a winter wonderland of snow on this beautiful Wednesday morning. We received another 5" of snowfall overnight on top of yesterday's continuous snowfall. The woods have filled in, the trees are white and fluffy, and the groomers are as soft as can be. Our mountain ops team left the snow guns off last night and allowed mother nature to continue to do their thing. Snowcats took to the trails to smooth out some bumps and groom in fresh stripes. The new snow is lighter than ever, and it will surely be a dream day on the hill today.</p><p>We have been told there is some wind present up top this morning. Although this wind should calm down reasonably early today, keep an eye on the mountain report this morning in case it affects some of our lifts' status. Partly cloudy skies are in the forecast for the day, with temps ranging from the low 20s this morning up to the mid-30s by the afternoon. We hope you can get a few runs in the week and enjoy searching for the freshies all over our eight peaks.</p><p>See you out there!<br />-Team Snow</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
