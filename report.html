</h6><p style="color: #696969; font-weight: 900; font-size: 12px;">MONDAY, JANUARY 18</p><p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="color: #333333;">Happy Monday at the mountain! With a storm that brought us 6-9&rdquo; of new snow this weekend, the mountain is looking pretty spectacular. Not only that but more importantly it is skiing and riding even better. The last few days ski patrol has been dropping ropes left and right with naturals opening up, giving us over 500 open acres to enjoy. Tonight the groomers are going to head out once the sun goes down to press out the snow for another perfect day of carving tomorrow.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: #333333;">Even though we had a storm bring us nearly a foot of snow, there is no such thing as too much snow for snowmakers. Tonight they plan to head back out on the mountain to fire up the snow guns on trails like Shockwave and Rocking Chair.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p><p>It's only Monday, but are you already dreaming of a weekend getaway?
