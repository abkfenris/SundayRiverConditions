<p><strong>February 17, 2022</strong></p><div><p>Soft turns for Thursday, anyone? Today is shaping up to be a respite from the cold temps that have socked in Western Maine since the New Year. The grooming team took to the slopes last night and did their thing, creating a playground that will be absolutely delightful under your skis today. Get here early for first chair and you'll be able to enjoy the fruits of their labor on trails like Upper Sunday Punch or Right Stuff. Trust us, it will be worth it. Some adverse weather is slated to roll in throughout the morning and into the afternoon, so packing your Gore-Tex is advisable. It may be a little wet, but it&rsquo;s going to be a lot of fun. Wind could come into play throughout the day, so as always, keep your eyes here for the most up-to-date lift and trail information.</p></div><div><div></div></div><p><strong>Around the Resort</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/presidents-week.xml" title="event listing">Presidents' Week</a> festivities start this weekend!
