Afternoon Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: December 10, 2023 </strong></em><strong>| 2:05 PM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>Nothing gets the holiday energy flowing quite like 300 Santas sleighing the slopes. Not only is this one of our favorite events of the year but we're blown away by the generosity that culminated in over $8,000 in donations to the River Fund Maine. In addition, this weekend also saw the first chairs come and go on the Barker 6, and the first drinks poured in the brand new Alpeniglu at Sunday River. It's been a weekend for the books, and we can't thank everyone enough for being a part of the next chapter of Sunday River.</p><p>While Mother Nature has been good to us so far, the weather she's sending us tonight may land her on Santa's naughty list. There's no two ways about it folks, it's going to rain. While we always prefer our precipitation to be frozen this time of year, sometimes you have to play the cards you are dealt. Fortunately for us, we have one of the best Mountain Operations teams in the business, with decades of experience making lemonade out of lemons.&nbsp;</p><p>For tonight, the grooming team will be out addressing key areas in preparation for opening tomorrow. The plan is to touch as little of the snow as possible, which will allow any unfrozen precipitation to naturally disperse. This move will let our snow surfaces rebound as quickly as possible, and allow for grooming operations to resume tomorrow night.&nbsp;</p><p>Snowmaking will be on hold tonight due to the warm temps. The silver lining in this weather pattern is the prolonged stretch of cold that follows. The team will be ready and waiting to fire up the snowmaking system as soon as temps drop. The primary focus will be on resurfacing key areas, followed closely by adding terrain for next weekend.</p><p>For tomorrow, please note that weather may impact operations. <span>Keep an eye on the mountain report for a full list of open trails, lifts, and any wind holds.</span><span></span></p><p>Think cold!</p><p>- Team Snow</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
