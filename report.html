Morning Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: December 8, 2023 </strong></em><strong>| 7:36 AM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>Buckle those boots folks, because we've got another great day ahead of us. We're looking at temperatures in the upper twenties to low thirties, and by mid-morning, we should have full-on bluebird skies. Sounds just about perfect to us, so let's get out there and carve up that corduroy.&nbsp;</p><p>We've got over 200 acres of open terrain today, with the majority of our open terrain having fresh corduroy. If you're looking for some ungroomed terrain, head over to Aludra, Borealis, and Airglow. T2 and Monday Mourning also have hill space today, and the T-bar is spinning for racers. We'll have snowmaking on some trails today in anticipation of this weekend, so be aware that as you're heading down through Lower Broadway, there will be snowmaking in action.</p><p>Lastly, please be aware that there is no ski-in/ski-out access to Barker Basin. Our Mountain Ops team will be hard at work there today, getting it ready for tomorrow.</p><p>Speaking of tomorrow, the Barker 6 is almost here! Join us for the celebration tomorrow morning, starting at 8:45AM, with the first chair spinning at 9AM.
