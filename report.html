Afternoon Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: February 25, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 1:34 PM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>With a temperature change of about 35 degrees, this afternoon has turned sunny and warm. Temps are in the high twenties to low thirties, and we have bluebird skies for the rest of the day. It may be the last day of Presidents' Week, but what a way to go.</p><p>Our snowmaking team will be back on the hill tomorrow, getting equipment ready for the next temperature window. Our grooming team will lay corduroy on our standard midweek trails, and we expect tomorrow's snow to be as fast as today's. In terms of lifts, the Aurora Quad will remain on hold. The Quantum Leap Triple will open tomorrow at 9AM. The Jordan Mountain Double will not open tomorrow. Lower Airglow and Supernova will be closed, but Northern Lights, Lower Vortex, Paradigm, Celestial, and Sensation will remain open. To get to Jordan without the Aurora Quad, take the Spruce Triple up, and then take Sirius to Aludra to Cyclone to State Fair.&nbsp;</p><p>It's never a bad time to review the Skier Responsibility Code. Take a moment, refresh yourself before heading out, and please remember to go slow in the base areas.</p><p>Have you looked at the new apr&egrave;s experience at the Alpeniglu at Sunday River? On Saturdays throughout the season, take a PistenBully cabin cat down to the igloo from Sliders and enjoy some sweets, drinks, and music, before taking the cat back up. <a href="https://shop.sundayriver.com/s/events/p/cat-ride-igloo-experience" title="Apres Experience | Sunday River, Maine">Tickets</a> are on sale now.&nbsp;</p><p>We'll see you out there!</p><p>- Team Snow</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
