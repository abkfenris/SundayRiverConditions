The clouds are rolling in this afternoon as Mother Nature brews up a storm on the horizon. If this storm plays out as we hope, we could see <strong>well over a foot of snow these next two days.</strong> Start thinking of excuses now, because when this storm hits, your happy place is where you'll want to be.&nbsp;</p><p>This is a prime opportunity to take advantage of our<a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/booklodging?Checkin=2021-2-1&amp;Checkout=&amp;Adults=2&amp;Children=0&amp;Others=0#/room.xml">&nbsp;20% off midweek lodging sale</a>&nbsp;to stay slopeside and hop on first chair and enjoy shredding all day, or to plan ahead and lock in a room with our <a href="/special-deals/presidents-week" title="presidents' week sale">Presidents' Weekend &amp; Week Sale</a> ending this Friday.</p><p>Lifts will open at 9AM tomorrow. Come to the mountain early and be ready to indulge in free refills all day. Rest those legs tonight, because this is going to be an awesome week. Please note that the cabins will remain off of the Chondola until this storm passes.</p><p><span>Please note we are&nbsp;</span><a title="Online Store" href="https://shop.sundayriver.com/s/lift-tickets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>requiring online lift ticket purchase</strong></a><span>&nbsp;and setting </span><strong>limits on the number of tickets</strong><span>&nbsp;sold for each day. This includes full-day, half-day, beginner, Threedom additional days, and Passholder Friend tickets. We only expect these limits to affect peak dates, but encourage everyone to buy early to ensure access on the dates you want. Season passes, Ikon passes, and lift ticket packs remain direct-to-lift with no restrictions or reservations.</span></p><p><span>Fast and contactless lift ticket pickup is available at our PUBs (Pick Up Boxes) at base lodges and hotels. Just scan the barcode at the bottom of your confirmation email and your RFID cards will print with your lift tickets or ticket packs loaded. For best results turn off dark mode on your phone if you use it and avoid email apps that use dark backgrounds.</span></p><p><span>Please remember to take a self-administered </span><a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/covid" title="Health Screening">Health Screening</a><span> and visit our&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/covid">COVID Winter Guide</a><span>&nbsp;before each trip to stay up-to-date on safety protocols and state guidelines.</span></p><p>Keep dancing!</p><p><span>Team Snow</span></p></div><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
