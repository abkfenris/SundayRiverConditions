Today is starting off quite wet out there, so pack your Gore-Tex and look for soft snow on ungroomed mashed potatoes as the groomers stayed off the hill last night. By the afternoon, we could see snowflakes falling in higher elevations. By tonight, temps drop into the snowmaking zone, so we are planning to <strong>run snowguns across Barker</strong>&nbsp;tonight into tomorrow morning. Looking ahead, this weekend's weather looks beautiful for spring skiing.
