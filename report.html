<p><strong>December 1, 2022 | 7:32 AM</strong></p><p>Welcome to December! We always get sentimental this time of year, and today we're really feeling thankful for our entire Mountain Operations team. Thanks to their tireless efforts throughout the beginning of the season, we're happy to report that we did not lose a single trail during last night's inopportune weather. Even better, the grooming team took to the hill in the early hours of the morning and kept their magic going, putting fresh stripes down across all open runs. All of this means that we are skiing and riding on <strong>the most open terrain in New England</strong>. Looking ahead, our first priority will be continuing to maintain open terrain, and then all eyes will shift to expansion. It's a beautiful morning here at Sunday River. We'll see you out there!</p><p>&nbsp;- Team Snow</p><p></p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
