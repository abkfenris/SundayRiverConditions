<h5>December 19, 2021</h5><ul></ul><p>It's a stunning day on the slopes, with fresh snow to shred for hours! With Mother Nature bringing 6-10" of powder on almost 50 trails and 300 acres, we have more terrain on the horizon for the holidays. Stripes will be put down across the mountain tonight, bringing you plenty of corduroy to carve tomorrow morning. Jordan Bowl opened this weekend along with Kansas, Cyclone, State Fair, and Lollapalooza. Snowmaking and grooming teams are working around the clock to give you even more options, with the most open terrain in the East you'll always be entertained.&nbsp;</p><p>Since Jordan Bowl is open, both hotels are now ski-in/ski-out access for your convenience. Please note our only beginner terrain is available within the South Ridge Express Quad at this time. With this in mind, skiing into the Grand Summit Hotel is currently accessible via blue terrain. At this time, we are sold out of snowboards at our rental shop for the duration of this weekend. Have a great afternoon skiing the snowy slopes, and catch us tomorrow for more!</p><p><strong>Around the Resort</strong></p><p>Recently opened for the season, Sliders Restaurant is conveniently located off Lollapalooza and inside the Jordan Hotel. The Mountain Room has also opened, located within Peak Lodge. For retail needs head over to Sunday River Sports, Betty's Treats and Treasures, or unwind at the Jordan Spa.</p><p>For the latest updates whenever you visit us, head to the <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/river-guide">River Guide</a>.</p><p>-Team Snow</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
