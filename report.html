Morning Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: February 21, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 6:35 AM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>We have over 700 acres of open terrain for you today, accessed by 17 lifts. There's a slight temperature inversion on the mountain right now, with temps in the mid-teens up top and single digits down low. That should flip by midmorning, and temperatures will rise to the low thirties in the base areas and mid-twenties up top. Winds should be light today, and the sun should be out.&nbsp;</p><p>Our grooming team was out all night, resurfacing terrain with corduroy and breaking up some of the firmer surfaces. We have 78 groomed trails today, and it'll be a great day to carve up the corduroy. Start the morning on Little White Cap or Merrill Hill for some green cruisers, or try your hand at classics like Right Stuff or Risky Business. White Heat, Excalibur, and Firestar will remain ungroomed, as our snowmaking team was back on the hill last night. All snowguns will be offline by 10AM, but there will be active snowmaking on those three trails until then. Monday Mourning also has a couple of snowguns running.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/presidents-week" title="Presidents' Week | Sunday River, Maine">Presidents' Week</a> is continuing, and our events schedule remains jam-packed.
