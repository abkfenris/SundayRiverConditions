<p><strong>November 20, 2022 | 6:20 AM</strong></p><p>Well, folks, the cats are out of the garage. That's the saying, right? After taking the first few operating days off to allow our snowmakers to make the most snow possible, our incredible grooming team took to the slopes last night for the first groom of the season. Upper Sunday Punch, T2, Ecstasy, Jungle Road, and Jim's Whim all received a fresh coat of corduroy. Cascades will also make its debut this morning, providing yet another top-to-bottom option. Snowmaking will still be active on Lower Cascades, Lower Sunday Punch, and Right Stuff, as the team continues to build our base in preparation for grooming. If you'd prefer to slide on steel than snow, Upper Sunday Punch has a fresh park build, with 5 features. Please note that lift access to the terrain park is only available off of the Locke Triple. All indications point towards a fantastic day on the slopes.</p><p>Pre-season conditions will continue to exist as we work on expanding our offerings. Please ski in control, and be aware of changing terrain. At this time, there is <strong>no beginner terrain</strong> available on the mountain. In addition to this,&nbsp;<strong>no uphill traffic is permitted at this time.</strong> Our team continues to work exceptionally hard to take advantage of the prolonged cold and open additional acreage as quickly as possible.</p><p>It's not too late to secure your <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/season-passes" title="Season Passes | Sunday River">New England Pass</a> or <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/ticket-packs">Maine Ticket Pack</a>.
