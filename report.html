Morning Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: March 4, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 7:15 AM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p><span>It's a moody Monday on this March morning. Temps are expected to stay fairly warm today, so the snow should be nice and soft across the resort. The summits likely won't exceed much beyond that 32 degree mark, so conditions will probably stay pretty solid up there, whereas down low it'll definitely turn much softer. We gained back a few natural trails yesterday, and since we haven't been getting super cold overnight, those trails remain open! Woohoo!</span></p><p><span>In other news, grooming smoothed out several trails across the resort, but be advised T2, Wildfire, and Rogue Angel will be ungroomed today.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>As always, check out the <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events">events calendar</a> for the lineup of activities and performances throughout the rest of the month. From the DJ series, to dinner with <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/eddy-and-betty-dinner-mar-12">Eddy and Betty</a>, to <a href="/events/bust-n-burn">Bust 'N' Burn</a>, there's something for everyone!&nbsp;</span></p><p>We'll see you out there!</p><p>- Team Snow</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
