Morning Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: February 22, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 6:35 AM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>We're anticipating slightly warmer temperatures than yesterday on this lovely Thursday. Skies will be mostly cloudy, winds will be light and variable, and we have over 720 acres of open terrain for you to explore. With a dusting of snow and 78 groomed trails, today is a great day to hit the slopes.</p><p>Our grooming team spent some extra time on the slopes last night, giving a few areas some extra love. We're looking at our standard list of groomed terrain for today, with the addition of Firestar after snowmaking there yesterday. The team brought out the winch cat last night, and they cleaned up Paradigm, Sunday Punch, and Grand Junction. Our snowmaking team spent the night on White Heat, Lollapalooza, and Excalibur. Those three trails will remain ungroomed with active snowmaking, and Lollapalooza will be advanced terrain today.</p><p>Do you know the Skier Responsibility Code? Take a moment to review that before heading out, and please remember to go slow in the base areas.</p><p><a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/presidents-week" title="Presidents' Week | Sunday River, Maine">Presidents' Week</a> is continuing, and our events schedule remains jam-packed.
