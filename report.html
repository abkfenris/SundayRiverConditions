LIFT TICKETS ARE SOLD OUT FOR SATURDAY, JANUARY 16</h6><p style="color: #696969; font-weight: 900; font-size: 12px;">WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 13</p><p>It's another fantastic day out there and we continue a stretch of perfect get-outside-and-do-something weather. The corduroy is set up for all the cruising you could ask for, thanks to our amazing team of groomers. Head to Obsession or Excalibur for long runs or test the steeps on Black Hole. Feelin' adventurous? Check out upper Downdraft for ungroomed post-snowmaking mounds that look a lot like a page out of a Dr. Suess story.&nbsp;</p><p>Snowmaking efforts continue across the resort, including Vortex and South Paw for the first time this season. We're looking forward to opening new terrain just in time for Martin Luther King Jr. weekend. Plus, we are currently offering <a href="/special-deals/mlk-lodging" title="MLK lodging sale">20% off resort lodging</a>&nbsp;for the long weekend with both of our slopeside hotels ski-in/ski-out.</p><p>Please note that we are experiencing high call volume in our call center and guest services, so we recommending using our&nbsp;<a href="/booklodging" target="_blank" title="Book Lodging " rel="noopener">online booking engine</a> for lodging quotes and booking, or our<a href="https://shop.sundayriver.com/s/lift-tickets/"> lift ticket store</a>&nbsp;for all ticket and pass purchases. Remember that a limited number of tickets are available each day. Please buy in advance to ensure access on weekends and holidays, as they are already sold out for this upcoming Saturday.</p><p>All three base areas lodges are open with parking and basic skier services, and South Ridge Lodge also offers season pass pickup, shopping, tuning, rentals, and SnowSports school.

Just scan the barcode at the bottom of your confirmation email and your RFID cards will print with your lift tickets or ticket packs loaded. For best results turn off dark mode on your phone if you use it and avoid email apps that use dark backgrounds.</p><p>Please remember that we are&nbsp;<a title="Online Store" href="https://shop.sundayriver.com/s/lift-tickets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>requiring online lift ticket purchase</strong></a> or reloading this season and setting <strong>limits on the number of tickets sold</strong> for each day. This includes day, half-day, beginner, Threedom additional days, and Passholder Friend tickets. We only expect these limits to come into play on peak dates, but encourage everyone to buy early to ensure access on the dates you want. Season passes, Ikon passes, and lift ticket packs remain direct-to-lift with no restrictions or reservations.</p><p>Lastly, please remember to check our <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/covid">COVID Winter Guide</a> before each visit to make a plan for your day and stay on top of any potential changes. We&rsquo;re in this together and need your help.</p><p>Masks up!</p><p>- Team Snow</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
