Morning Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: February 24, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 6:35 AM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>Temperatures are currently in the mid-teens up top and mid-twenties down in the base areas. There's a weather system moving through the areas, so we're expecting temps to drop throughout the day. We have over 745 acres of open terrain across the resort today, with over 80 groomed trails. Be sure to keep an eye on the lift and terrain status below for the most updated information.&nbsp;</p><p>Our grooming team was hard at work last night, and they cleaned up our usual list of groomed terrain. Try trails like Obsession and Jibe over on White Cap, or head in the other direction for a relaxed cruise on Lollapalooza. There's something for everyone in the family. Our snowmaking team was off last night, and they'll be back on the hill Monday night, ready to get to it. The Quantum Leap Triple and the Jordan Mountain Double will both open at 8AM today, and the Aurora Quad will remain on hold. Lower Airglow, Celestial, and Supernova will be closed, but Northern Lights, Lower Vortex, Paradigm, and Sensation will remain open.</p><p>It's never a bad time to review the Skier Responsibility Code. Take a moment, refresh yourself before heading out, and please remember to go slow in the base areas.</p><p><a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/presidents-week" title="Presidents' Week | Sunday River, Maine">Presidents' Week</a> schedule remains jam-packed, and tonight is the ultimate kid's night.
