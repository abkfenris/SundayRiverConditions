<p><strong>November 21, 2022 | 1:35 PM</strong></p><p>Another day skiing and riding under blue skies. What's better than that? The march towards expansion continues tonight, with another fantastic stretch of cold temperatures for our snowmakers to work their magic. The groomers will also make the first passes of the season down Right Stuff, Cascades, and Lower Sunday Punch, which means we will be skiing and riding on 100% groomed terrain. Looking ahead, we're in excellent shape heading into the holidays, with more terrain opening soon. If you're coming up for the holidays, don't forget to check out <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/thanksgiving-dinner">Thanksgiving Dinner at Camp</a>. You won't want to miss out on this delicious spread.</p><p>While our excellent Mountain Operations team has gotten most open terrain into mid-season condition already, pre-season conditions will continue to exist as we work on expanding our offerings. Please ski in control, and be aware of changing terrain. At this time, there is <strong>no beginner terrain</strong> available on the mountain. In addition to this,&nbsp;<strong>no uphill traffic is permitted at this time.</strong> Our team continues to work exceptionally hard to take advantage of the prolonged cold and open additional acreage as quickly as possible.</p><p>It's not too late to secure your <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/season-passes" title="Season Passes | Sunday River">New England Pass</a> or <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/ticket-packs">Maine Ticket Pack</a>.
