<h4><strong>February 11, 2023 | 1:50 PM</strong></h4><h4><strong style="font-size: 2em;">Afternoon Report</strong></h4><p>What a classic east coast day of skiing and riding it was out there today. The temps were mild, and there wasn't a cloud in the sky. Strong winds gave us some difficulties for a little in the morning, but as the day went on, things calmed down, and all went back to as scheduled.</p><p>Tonight our mountain ops team will head out to the trails to clean up our track from today. Snowcats will smooth it out and groom in stripes back onto our trails. Snowmaking will turn back on in a few areas to add to our base and push to open up the last of the runs we have closed.</p><p>Tomorrow looks like another beautiful day to be outside with partly cloudy skies and temps ranging in the 30s.</p><p>If you're looking for some fun after skiing today, check out the<a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/apres-and-nightlife"> live music</a> happening all over the resort this afternoon, from the Foggy Goggle to Barker bar, as well as late-night music at the Shipyard Brewpub. The fun never stops here in western Maine; we hope you can come to enjoy it for yourself soon.</p><p>See you in the morning!<br />-Team Snow</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
