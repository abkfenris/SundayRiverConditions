Trails are predictably wet, but still hikeable. If you're participating in TMC in July, then you're in luck! Because you will be encountering mud, water, and some slippery slabs on many trails and this can serve as a great training opportunity.</p><p>Hiking trails currently open: I, J, D, E, A, H, K, B, C, M, O, and L</p><p>Hiking trails currently closed: G</p><p>As you go out on your hike, please make sure you're prepared by knowing your route, having water/snacks, and wearing appropriate footwear. Additionally, closed zones remain in effect across the resort. Please obey all signs and keep an eye out for construction vehicles driving up the mountain roads.&nbsp;</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
