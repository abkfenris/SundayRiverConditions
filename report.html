<h4><strong>March 5, 2023 | 6:30 AM</strong><strong></strong></h4><h4><strong style="font-size: 2em;">Morning Report</strong></h4><p>As the Sun rises over the distant mountains, our team prepares the resort for another incredible day in western Maine. Shovels are out, Lifts are beginning to spin, and ski patrol is getting into position. It's a bright, crisp winter morning as temperatures rise to the mid-30s for the day.</p><p>Snowcats crawled up and down the slopes last night to lay down some grade-A stripes and push down all the built-up snow from the past few days. We ended yesterday with over 12" of freshly fallen snow, so 100% of our terrain is open, and plenty of powder remains to be found. Skied-off natural terrain will be bumped up and soft by mid-day. Perfect conditions to get in the front of your boots and just point 'em down hill. Take advantage of the over 850 acres of terrain we have to offer and search for the line of the day.</p><p>Be mindful of others today as we all get out on the mountain to enjoy what is going to be another fantastic day of skiing and riding here at Sunday River. <span data-preserver-spaces="true">Want to enjoy the snow we have been getting recently?
