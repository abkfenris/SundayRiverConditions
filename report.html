Morning Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: February 9, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 7:35 AM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>Good morning and happy Friday, everyone. Temps are solidly in the mid-twenties right now across the resort, but as things warm up throughout the day, it'll hit the high twenties up top and mid-thirties at the base. The clouds of this morning should mostly burn off by this afternoon, giving way to some beautiful sunshine.&nbsp;</p><p>For groomed trails today, we have our standard midweek trails, including most green and blue terrain. Three Mile Trail remains ungroomed. Rogue Angel was groomed last night, and it'll be a firm one this morning. Lower Vortex was groomed, and Upper Vortex remains ungroomed after snowmaking yesterday. Airglow also remains ungroomed after snowmaking. Shock Wave opened yesterday as advanced, ungroomed terrain. Our snowmaking team took care of some maintenance and set up last night with the warmer temps, and as soon as the temps fall back into the correct window, they'll continue resurfacing terrain.&nbsp;</p><p>We have <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/winter-activities/night-skiing" title="Twilight Skiing | Sunday River, Maine">twilight skiing</a> skiing tonight off of the Chondola and the South Ridge Express.
