<p><strong>February 25, 2022</strong></p><p>We are making snow alongside Mother Nature! Flurries are currently flying on the mountain as forecasts call for 6-10&rdquo; of snowfall totals into tonight. We already have fresh snow falling across 8 peaks before first chair at 8AM. Snowguns blasted all night and are continuing into this morning, on trails including Risky Business and Dream Maker. Today, snowmakers are adding trails to their list, including Right Stuff and Lower Sunday Punch. Shred all day, then head to South Ridge for <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/winter-activities/night-skiing.xml" title="Twilight Skiing">Twilight Skiing</a> until 6:30PM tonight, to take as many powdery turns as possible. Groomers put corduroy on 80 trails to make a beautiful base for all this new snow. After skiing in a winder wonderland all today, hit the slopes for a bluebird tomorrow as forecasts call for sunshine after snow.
