<p><strong>February 14, 2022</strong></p><p>Love is in the air, and freshly made flakes are on our trails! Since yesterday, snowguns have been blasting on Right Stuff and T72 into this afternoon. Now, snowmakers are still putting piles on T72, and have added Cascades and Ecstasy to their list so far. Groomers are making beautiful corduroy on 80 trails tonight, including Right Stuff, for you to carve at 9AM first chair tomorrow morning. Come choose from 125 open trail options for you to take your turns. We couldn't be happier as cooler temperatures roll in, bringing us ideal conditions for making snow.
