Low-lying clouds and drizzle last night made for an interesting morning, but thanks to the hard work of our Mountain Ops team, and some warming from Mother Nature, we're having ourselves a good 'ol day of spring skiing. Temps are expected to stay mild throughout the night, which will make for delightful soft turns for first chair.&nbsp;</p><p>Grooming will take to the hill tonight to resurface their standard trails in need. Please note, high winds are forecasted throughout the day and may impact lift operations. As always, keep an eye on the Mountain Report for the most up-to-date operational info.</p><p>After tomorrow's potential wind, it's shaping up to be an excellent run of weather here in Western Maine, and we've got a full slate of awesome Spring events coming at you this weekend.
