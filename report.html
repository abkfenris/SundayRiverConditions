<h4><strong>December 27, 2022 | 1:10 PM</strong></h4><h2><strong>Afternoon Update</strong><span></span></h2><p>Some clouds stuck around today, and we even received a few surprising snow flurries here and there this morning. Lift buddies commented that the snow conditions were "firm, fast and fun." As the day went on, the sun peaked through the moving clouds. Moderate winds were present throughout the day, but weren't enough to put any lifts on hold.</p><p>Going into the night, our operation team will be at it again, blowing snow onto new trails to grow our already long list of open terrain. The snow cats will get on the hill at night to groom out and fix up all available trails for another day ahead. If you haven't gotten enough turns in today, twilight skiing will be available tonight until 6:30PM out of South Ridge.</p><p>Tomorrow looks like another classic winter day with 20-degree weather and mild winds. All open terrain will be groomed, and some trails may have active snowmaking during the morning. If you're getting tired or cold during the day, head to any of our open lodges to warm up and enjoy food from one of our multiple<a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/resort-dining"> dining options</a>. As always, make sure to check the mountain report for all lift and trail updates throughout the day.</p><p><br />We will see you tomorrow<br />-Team Snow</p><p><b>UPDATED Uphill Policy</b><span>: Uphill travel is NOT</span><span>&nbsp;permitted until further notice.&nbsp;</span></p><p></p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
