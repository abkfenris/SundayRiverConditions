<h4><strong>February 25, 2023 | 6:30 AM</strong></h4><h4><strong style="font-size: 2em;">Morning Report</strong></h4><p>Good morning rippers and riders, and welcome to another beautiful Saturday here in western Maine. Our groomers got out overnight to provide us with a fantastic ski product after the last few days of fresh snowfall. Powder stashes will still be in the woods and side trails, especially as the wind blew snow around yesterday. Oz Quad will remain closed today, but all of that natural terrain can still be accessed off of the Jordan 8 via Kansas.</p><p>Today's weather looks a little chilly, so bundle up as temps will be sticking around the teens to low 20s all day. We have been told this morning is a bit windy at the top, but things should calm down as the sun rises over the mountains. However, keep an eye on the mountain report for any updates on lift statuses as we start our day. Ski patrol will inspect the last few trails we are working on opening. Let's hope the fresh snow will be enough to make our mountain 100% open very soon. With fresh snow to be found and fast, soft groomers to get you there, it looks like a great day to get lost in the views and explore all that our eight peaks have to offer.</p><p>We love that our guests are exploring new terrain while enjoying the beautiful views and spectacular homes on Merrill Hill and The Glades. With that in mind, we ask that all guests be respectful of the private property directly adjacent to groomed surfaces by avoiding venturing off trail and staying within the boundary lines of the resort. Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.</p><p>Be sure to check out all the <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/apres-and-nightlife">live music</a> and events this weekend for <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/presidents-week">Presidents' week</a>.&nbsp; Looking to spend the night?
