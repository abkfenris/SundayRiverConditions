Afternoon Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: November 23, 2023 </strong></em><strong>| 2:32PM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>Now, this is our kind of turkey trot! Fast laps off Jordan 8 under sunny blue skies and soft, carvable snow underfoot. Excalibur even joined in on the fun today with ungroomed, natural terrain and whales as far as the eyes can see. The deck at Sliders was the perfect place to cap off your day before heading home for holiday celebrations. Our Mountain Ops team will be back at it as the colder temps return late tonight. We're looking at a productive snowmaking window coming up and their eyes are set on expansion. Did you leave too tired to cook?&nbsp; We'll take care of that for you! Join us at Camp for <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/thanksgiving-dinner">Thanksgiving Dinner</a> this evening.&nbsp;</p><p>Speaking of expansion..... Locke will be open to the public tomorrow with access to Upper Punch and Cascades! There will be no downloading on Locke Triple. Please be aware that there is no terrain connecting Jordan Bowl and Locke Mountain and you will need to pick your peak. With the ongoing Barker 6 construction, parking will be very limited at Barker. We recommend heading to South Ridge to park and catching the shuttle over for Locke access.&nbsp;</p><p>Lastly, we've officially kicked off our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/cyber-sale" title="Cyber Sale | Sunday River, Maine">Cyber Sale,</a> with deep discounts on lodging, lift tickets, ticket packs, and other deals. If you've been holding off planning your next favorite vacation, the time is now to lock it in and save.</p><p>Please note that early-season, variable terrain will be present on all trails.
