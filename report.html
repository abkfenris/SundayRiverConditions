<h4><strong>March 6, 2023 | 7:12 AM</strong><strong></strong></h4><h4><strong style="font-size: 2em;">Morning Report</strong></h4><p>Good morning everyone! We've got the makings of a gorgeous day here at Sunday River. The temperature at the base is holding in the mid-20s, the groomers continued to work in the 3 feet of snow from the last week, and we've got a bright blue sky stretching across all 8 peaks. The only thing keeping us from saying it's a perfect day is the wind. We've got a pretty brisk breeze coming across the resort. At this time we are not sure how this will affect lift operations. Our lift ops team and patrol are currently monitoring wind and assessing each lift's ability to run safely. We will update the Mountain Report with more information once we have it.</p><p>Aside from that, it's business as usual. The conditions are the best we've skied all year, and there's plenty of winter left to go.&nbsp;</p><p>Rest up, March is just getting started.</p><p>- Team Snow</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
