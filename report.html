Morning Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: January 25, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 7:34 AM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>We're looking at temperatures in the mid-thirties to mid-forties today, with mostly cloudy skies and low winds. The unfrozen precipitation of last night froze over by this morning, so things are slick out there. Sharpen those edges before you hit the slopes. The sun should peek out from behind the clouds this morning, which will also help.&nbsp;</p><p>Our grooming team is out on the hill right now, breaking up any frozen surfaces. Most of our beginner terrain received a fresh pass this morning, and they began working on our intermediate terrain. We expect our advanced and expert terrain to remain ungroomed. Be sure to check the lift and trail status here throughout the day. Our snowmaking team turned off the guns with rising temps last night, and we're planning to turn them back on in the next few days.</p><p>We're officially midway into Senior Week, and we have a whole list of events for you to enjoy, including live music and karaoke.
