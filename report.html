<h4><strong>April 14, 2023 | 3:05 PM</strong><strong></strong></h4><h4><strong style="font-size: 2em;">Afternoon Report</strong></h4><p>Hope you packed your sunscreen! It's nothing but sunshine and soft snow today, and we can't get enough. The skiing is incredible, and we can&rsquo;t wait to see you all this weekend for the final rides on the Barker Express.</p><p>While we&rsquo;re incredibly excited for all of the sunshine and celebrations this weekend, we do regrettably have to announce some changes to our <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/spring">Spring Operations schedule</a>.</p><p>The lift operations team, as well as representatives from Doppelmayr, have been battling a mechanical issue with the Jordan 8. Unfortunately, we will not be able to open the lift this weekend, so we have made the difficult decision to close Jordan until further notice while we continue to work on the problem.</p><p>Due to this change, we are adjusting our other lift operations to provide the most skiing we can. The Chondola will spin this weekend, with ski-in/ski-out from South Ridge access via Lower Lazy River. The Barker Express, Spruce Peak Triple, and White Cap quad will also run this weekend.</p><p>We were incredibly excited for the next two weekends of spring skiing in the Jordan Bowl, and this is definitely not how we wanted to end our season. We apologize for the inconvenience this causes and will continue to aim to make the best weekend possible with our available lifts. Our teams will continue to do everything they can to get the Jordan 8 running for our planned closing weekend. Any updates will be announced here, so keep an eye out for any further changes in our plan.</p><p>Have fun and ski safe!&nbsp;</p><p>-Team Snow</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
