<p><strong>February 27, 2022</strong></p><p>Take fresh turns on daily snowmaking powder! We have been blasting snowguns on Cascades, Ecstasy, and Obsession since last night, and will continue into tomorrow. We keep opening terrain as we make more flakes on top of our recent 8" snowfall from Mother Nature. Choose from 115 open glades and trails as you ski through your Sunday. Please keep an eye on the lift and trail status as winds may impact lifts this afternoon. Look forward to snowmakers adding even more trails to their list for tomorrow, including Lazy River and Tourist Trap. Groomers are pushing out huge piles of powder on Right Stuff tonight, making exquisite corduroy for you to carve at 9AM first chair. Tomorrow morning nearly 90 trails with fresh stripes will help you shred away your Monday blues!</p><p><strong>Around the Resort</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/presidents-week.xml" title="Presidents' Week Schedule">Visit Eddy &amp; Betty</a> the Yetis at <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/resort-shopping/bettys-treats-and-treasures.xml" title="shopping">Betty's Treats &amp; Treasures</a> this afternoon!
