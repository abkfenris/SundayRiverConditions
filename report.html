<p><strong>December 6, 2022 | 7:38 AM</strong></p><p><span data-contrast="auto" xml:lang="EN-US" lang="EN-US" class="TextRun SCXW121676824 BCX0"><span class="NormalTextRun SpellingErrorV2Themed SCXW121676824 BCX0">More often than not, having a "glass-half-full" mentality can be very beneficial. When you're a skier in a weather pattern like the one we're currently in, that certainly rings true. Unsettled weather is forecasted to move in throughout the afternoon, which means this morning will be nothing but soft, carvable turns on <strong>the most open terrain in New England</strong>. On top of that, the light drizzle we're in store for over the next 24-36 hours should only drop a half inch or so of rain, an amount that our snowpack can easily handle. Our snowmakers will be taking the night off, but don't worry, they'll be ready to get back after our ambitious expansion plans as soon as temps allow.</span></span></p><p><span data-contrast="auto" xml:lang="EN-US" lang="EN-US" class="TextRun SCXW121676824 BCX0"><span class="NormalTextRun SpellingErrorV2Themed SCXW121676824 BCX0">Speaking of expansion, snowmaking heading into the White Cap basin and the Grand Summit Hotel has gone exceptionally well. If everything goes to plan, we're expecting intermediate-ability ski-in, ski-out access to the Grand Summit by this weekend. You may notice groomed terrain heading that direction in the coming days. Lift access will not be available from the White Cap basin until this weekend, so please heed all signage and warnings posted by ski patrol.&nbsp;</span></span></p><p>We'll see you out there!</p><p>-Team Snow</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
