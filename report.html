<h4><strong>March 3, 2023 | 2:10 PM</strong><strong></strong></h4><h4><strong style="font-size: 2em;">Afternoon Report</strong></h4><p>It was a day for the memory books out there today. The clear bluebird skies and bright shining sun created the perfect weather for another day of skiing and riding. Groomed trails started the morning in pristine condition. Although the sun softened the surface, our trails held their shape and remained smooth until midday. Bumps and moguls may form eventually as more people get to the slopes, but it has held up for most of the day.</p><p>Looking into the weekend, we have quite the storm ahead tonight. Starting around midnight, snow will begin to fall at up to 2" per hour. This snowfall isn't scheduled to stop until night Saturday. Forecasts are estimating 8-12" in our area, another significant dumping of snow for us to enjoy over the weekend. Temps will range in the mid to high 20s for the day, and visibility may be pretty low due to the heavy snowfall.</p><p>Our team will get out as soon as they can tonight to groom out as much terrain as possible before this storm begins. We will be back to running 100% of our lifts for the weekend from 8-4, with twilight skiing at South Ridge from 4-6:30 tonight and tomorrow night. Let's hope this storm gets stuck in western Maine tomorrow and can provide us with as much snow as possible for the next few days ahead.
