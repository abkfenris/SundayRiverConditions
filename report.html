Afternoon Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: April 7, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 1:40 PM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>If you're on the hunt for spring skiing, look no further because it has arrived. Perfect conditions all over the mountain once the snow had a chance to warm up. 10/10. No notes.&nbsp;</p><p>In case you've missed the news, we've got the <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/eclipse" title="solar eclipse">Eclipse</a> tomorrow! The event peak should be around 3:30PM with a 1-hour lift shutdown to enjoy the event. Scenic lift tickets are still available for those choosing not to ski, but must be purchased by 2PM Monday. We are expecting traffic, so if you're arriving later in the day and want to watch from the mountain, give yourself a cushion and get here a bit earlier. We've got a party happening up at North Peak with the <a href="https://mainemineralmuseum.org/" title="MMGM">Maine Gem and Mineral museum</a> and the weather looks PHENOMENAL, so spending a few extra minutes on the deck with a beer sounds like a nice way to enjoy the afternoon.&nbsp;</p><p>If anything changes between now and the eclipse, we'll update the Mountain Report with more most current information.</p><p>As a reminder, all new <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/season-passes">New England Passes</a> automatically qualify for immediate access all Spring long, so buy now, ski now, and maximize the value of your pass now!</p><p>We'll see you out there!</p><p>- Team Snow</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
