<h4><strong>December 23, 2022 | 7:30 AM</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></h4><h2><strong>Morning Update</strong></h2><p>Good morning and happy holidays. We've got a bit of a mixed bag coming at you today, so let's dive into it.</p><p>In general, we've always found it better to start with the bad news. Right now, it's raining, and it's windy, which are both not ideal for ski resort operations. At this time, we are moving forward with our daily plan of opening 10 lifts and 57 trails. Our patrol and lift operations team will be constantly monitoring the weather and will make all decisions regarding our operating status with safety as the #1 priority. As soon as we need to divert from our plan, we will update you with current information here.&nbsp;</p><p>Now to the good news. Before this rain moved in, we picked up 4-6" of new snow. While this snow won't survive the rain, it will create an insulating layer to protect our snowpack from any deterioration. In addition to this, the storm is now forecasted to move through the area much faster than originally anticipated, which means less impact on the snow surfaces. In short, this is hardly an ideal situation, but it could have been&nbsp;<strong>a lot</strong> worse.&nbsp;</p><p>As always, the Sunday River team is ready for whatever comes. We have the plan, equipment, and personnel in place to shift into recovery as soon as possible, and provide a phenomenal skiing surface for you, our guests.</p><p>Keep an eye on the mountain report as updates come in throughout the day.</p><p>-Team Snow</p><p>&nbsp;</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
