<h4><strong>February 20, 2023 | 6:25 PM</strong></h4><h4><strong style="font-size: 2em;">Morning Report</strong></h4><p>Happy Monday and happy Presidents' Day to all of our skiers and riders! We've got a great day on tap with some mild temps as the day progresses and some freshly groomed trails. Right Stuff, White Heat, and Rogue Angel got some snowmaking attention the last couple of nights and all that new snow has been groomed in and should make for a great surface. Most ungroomed and glade runs will remain closed, but patrol will be monitoring their conditions, and fingers crossed that the warmer temps will soften things up and maybe open a few more areas.</p><p>The weather looks, you guessed it, warm. Temps should reach mid 30's under a layer of clouds that will hopefully burn off. Could be a great day to hang on the Foggy Goggle deck with a beer and some nachos.</p><p>Other than that, Rocking Chair will remain closed until March 6. We have cats actively grooming the slope for a ski and snowboard cross event, and the trail will not be open until after the event.&nbsp;</p><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Remember to check out everything we have happening this week for Presidents' Week.
