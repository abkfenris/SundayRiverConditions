<p><strong>February 15, 2022</strong></p><p>Snowmaking and sun on the slopes! We couldn't be happier as snowmakers have added more trails to our lengthening list of terrain with freshly made snow for today. Take powdery turns on T72, Right Stuff, Cascades, Ecstasy, Sunday Punch, and Tourist Trap this afternoon. Cooler temperatures have brought us ideal conditions for snowguns to blast for the past several days. Tonight, groomers are putting corduroy across the mountain on trails including Ecstasy. Choose from 132 trails today, spanning across 855 acres of groomed and natural terrain. Please keep an eye on the lift and trail status, as winds may impact lifts before last chair. Enjoy shredding under blue skies this afternoon, or carve-in when lifts spin at 9AM first chair!</p><p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline;">Little White Cap Quad will be closed for maintenance today. Please note at this time the Grand Summit Hotel is not accessible via beginner trails. All ski-in/out access to the Grand Summit Hotel temporarily requires navigation of intermediate and more advanced terrain.</p><p><strong>Around the Resort</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/presidents-week.xml" title="event listing">Presidents' Week</a> festivities start this weekend!
