<p><strong>December 15, 2022 | 7:35 AM</strong></p><p>Good morning and happy Thursday! It's looking like another great day, the sun is making its way out, and temps will range in the 20s-40s all day. A great day to get out there and warm your ski legs up for the snowy days to follow.<br />Our team was able to get out there last night and paint some fresh lines on all open terrain throughout the resort. The snow guns were blasting onto new trails last night, preparing us for terrain expansion. The wind is holding off today and will allow us to reopen the Spruce Peak Triple and the Chondola.</p><p>If you plan to head out today, I'd recommend exploring all of our trails and checking out areas where the sun is hitting the most. This will be your best chance to find softer, more playful conditions.</p><p>We are eager to get to the weekend to see what this hopeful storm offers. With snow in the forecast for Friday and Saturday, best to pack your car early and get up here as soon as possible. And if the chance of fresh snow isn't enough to get you off the couch, don't forget about everything going on this weekend to kick off <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/winterfest-weekend">Winterfest</a>!</p><p>&nbsp;We will see you out there.</p><p>- Team Snow</p><p></p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
