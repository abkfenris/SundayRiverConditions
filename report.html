Tickets are sold out for today, but still available for Sunday.</h6><p style="color: #696969; font-weight: 900; font-size: 12px;">SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 6</p><div><p>After an absolutely beautiful week, we have kept the momentum going for the weekend and have been enjoying some awesome conditions across all eight peaks. Ropes dropped on Northern Exposure today and <strong>we are 100% open</strong>. There's a lot to enjoy out there, so keep it up until 6:30PM with <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/winter-activities/night-skiing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twilight Skiing</a>&nbsp;and end your night on the slopes with a fireworks show at 7PM at South Ridge. Come back tomorrow to do it all over again and expect a visit from Mother Nature around noon for a few inches of new snow.&nbsp;</p><p>Lift tickets are sold out for today and are filling up quickly for Sunday so make sure to buy yours soon. Don't forget that&nbsp;resort lodging guests can always purchase tickets at the front desks of their property, even when we're sold out.&nbsp;</p><p>When enjoying the snow out there, please keep in mind lift lines may appear longer than they actually are. Due to social distancing in and between lines, plus guests only riding with their traveling group, lines look longer than we're used to seeing, but move rather quickly.&nbsp;</p><p><span>Please note we are&nbsp;</span><a title="Online Store" href="https://shop.sundayriver.com/s/lift-tickets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>requiring online lift ticket purchase</strong></a><span>&nbsp;and setting </span><strong>limits on the number of tickets</strong><span>&nbsp;sold for each day. This includes full-day, half-day, beginner, Threedom additional days, and Passholder Friend tickets. We only expect these limits to affect peak dates, but encourage everyone to buy early to ensure access on the dates you want. Season passes, Ikon passes, and lift ticket packs remain direct-to-lift with no restrictions or reservations.</span></p><p><span>Fast and contactless lift ticket pickup is available at our PUBs (Pick Up Boxes) at base lodges and hotels. Just scan the barcode at the bottom of your confirmation email and your RFID cards will print with your lift tickets or ticket packs loaded. For best results turn off dark mode on your phone if you use it and avoid email apps that use dark backgrounds.</span></p><p><span>Please remember to take a self-administered </span><a title="Health Screening" href="https://www.sundayriver.com/covid">Health Screening</a><span> and visit our&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/covid">COVID Winter Guide</a><span>&nbsp;before each trip to stay up-to-date on safety protocols and state guidelines.</span></p><p>Masks up!</p><p><span>Team Snow</span></p></div><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
