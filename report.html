<p><strong>February 27, 2022</strong></p><p><span>Freshly made snow every day! Snowguns are still blasting across the peaks as we add to the 8" recent snow from Mother Nature. Blasting since yesterday, snowmakers continue adding to Obsession, Cascades, and Ecstasy as we ski through the day. Groomers pushed out snowmaking piles on Risky Business and Lower Sunday Punch, making beautiful corduroy for you to enjoy. Carve into 85 trails with stunning stripes at 8AM first chair, or shred all-natural trails including Right Stuff and Ecstasy. Choose from 111 trails and glades this morning, spanning across more than 700 acres of open terrain. We have a few forecasted flurries rolling in later today, so please keep an eye on the lift and trail status as winds may impact lifts. Top off your vacation week with lots of trail options to take your turns!</span></p><p><strong>Around the Resort</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/presidents-week.xml" title="Presidents' Week Schedule">Visit Eddy &amp; Betty</a> the Yetis at <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/resort-shopping/bettys-treats-and-treasures.xml" title="shopping">Betty's Treats &amp; Treasures</a> this afternoon!
