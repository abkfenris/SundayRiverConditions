<h4><strong>April 23, 2023 | 6:45 AM</strong><strong></strong></h4><h4><strong style="font-size: 2em;">Morning Report</strong></h4><p>This is it folks. The closing day for the 2022-23 season is upon us. Thank you all for being a part of it. We couldn't do it without you.&nbsp;</p><p>First and foremost, for folks without a season pass or ticket pack to use, today is our annual free ski day.&nbsp; We will be accessing the lift through our RFID gates, which means that you must have your pass on you, or a lift ticket loaded onto your RFID Go Card. Today only, lift tickets are 0$, <a href="https://shop.sundayriver.com/s/lift-tickets/c/lift-tickets-1" title="Online Store | Sunday River">but still must be loaded onto a Go Card through the online store</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The Jordan 8 will spin from 8AM-4PM. Skiing will be on groomed terrain on Lollapalooza, Rogue Angel, and Excalibur, and ungroomed terrain on Lost Princess. There will be no beginner terrain available this weekend. In addition, we will have no lessons or rentals either.</p><p>Limited skier services will be available out of the Jordan Hotel. The Welcome Center in South Ridge will be open for further assistance on lift tickets or other purchases. We recommend stopping in South Ridge before going to Jordan if there are any lingering questions about your ticket or pass.</p><p>Parking will be based out of the Lower Jordan Parking Lot. This lot can be found on the left-hand side of the road when approaching the hotel. When you have your gear all on, you can access Lollapalooza at the southwest end of the parking lot, closest to the trail and the hotel. Walking will be required to get to the snow surface, but it's not far, we promise.&nbsp;</p><p>Food service will be available at the Sliders deck, with tasty options to fuel you up throughout the day.&nbsp;</p><p>From all of us here at Sunday River, enjoy the final turns of the season. We'll see you out there!</p><p>-Team Snow</p><p></p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
