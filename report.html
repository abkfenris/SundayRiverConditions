<p><strong>November 16, 2022 | 1:05 PM</strong></p><p>We could not be more excited to announce that daily operations for the 2022-23 winter season begin tomorrow, November 17, at 9:00 AM for New England Pass, Ikon Pass, and Ticket Pack holders. Daily lift ticket access will begin Saturday, November 19 at 8:00 AM. Thanks to our amazing snowmakers and a helping hand from Mother Nature, we will be spinning the Locke Mountain Triple, with loading required from the mid-station. Advanced terrain will be available on T2 and Upper Sunday Punch. Downloading will be required. Last chair will be thrown at 3:15PM, so be sure to get here early enough to get your first turns of the season in.</p><p>Snowmaking operations may be active at any time on the mountain, so be prepared to ski under the snow guns. A buff or something of the sort is perfect for wiping off the goggles! At this time, there is <strong>no beginner terrain</strong> available on the mountain. In addition to this, due to limited terrain availability, <strong>no uphill traffic is permitted at this</strong>&nbsp;<strong>time.&nbsp;</strong>Our team is working exceptionally hard to take advantage of the prolonged cold and open additional terrain as fast as possible.&nbsp;</p><p>If the FOMO is already setting in, it's not too late to secure your <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/season-passes" title="Season Passes | Sunday River">New England Pass</a> or <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/ticket-packs">Maine Ticket Pack</a>. For those of you looking to take advantage of Cyber Monday savings, the wait is over. We're kicking off our biggest sale of the year early with up to 30% off lodging, and lift tickets from as low as $55. All the details can be <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/cyber-monday" title="Cyber Monday | Sunday River">found here</a>. Holiday availability is filling up fast, and with cold temps forecast through Thanksgiving, expansion is on the horizon.&nbsp;</p><p>We've been waiting for this day since the closing day of last season, and we cannot wait to welcome you back to your happy place. We'll see you out there!</p><p>&nbsp;- Team Snow</p><p></p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
