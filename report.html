<h4><strong>January 8, 2023 | 6:35 AM</strong></h4><h2><strong>Morning Update</strong><span></span></h2><p>Good morning my fellow Sunday River riders, and happy Sunday. The skies are clear, and the sun is just beginning to peak over the mountains on this crisp 20-degree morning.</p><p>Our Mountain Ops team took advantage of the colder temps last night and this morning. The crew turned on over 250 guns to make a fresh layer of snow. Some snowmaking will continue today on trails such as Lower Down Draft, Grand Rapids, Easy Street, and a few still closed trails. This snow will be pushed around and smoothed out by the first chair this morning, laying new stripes onto all open terrain.</p><p>It looks like we should have a bluebird day with the sun shining bright and clear skies. Winds up top are pretty gusty this morning; however, everything should calm down as the day continues. Keep an eye on the mountain report for&nbsp; trail and lift status changes as Ski Patrol hit the mountain to inspect conditions.</p><p><strong>Please note:</strong> There is currently no beginner terrain into and out of the Grand Summit Hotel.</p><p>Visiting Sunday River anytime soon?
