<h4><strong>January 16, 2023 | 6:35 AM</strong></h4><h2><strong>Morning Report</strong><span></span></h2><p>It's been a wonderful weekend of skiing and riding, but we're not done yet. Cloudy skies are expected to prevail today, but those clouds are expected to bring snow showers throughout the day. Accumulations are not expected to be significant, but it will be delightful to have flakes flying. Our snowmakers aren't going to let Mother Nature one-up them, and will continue to take advantage of cold temps as long they persist. Keep an eye out for active snowmaking on open trails, and check out the <a href="/mountain-report#trail_status">snowmaking status</a> as trails come on and off-line.</p><p>Looking ahead, we're keeping an eye on a storm for the end of the week, but more on that later. It's been a great few days here in Western Maine, and with any luck, the pattern of this winter is finally starting to change for the better. Keep those snow dances coming!</p><p>&nbsp;See you up there!<br />-Team Snow</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
