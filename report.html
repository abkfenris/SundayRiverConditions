<h5>January 8, 2022</h5><p>Goggle tans and perfect turns, does it get much better than that? Today was one for the books, and with another shot of snow on the way for tomorrow morning, this weekend is just getting started. Our snowmakers will be out in force this evening with sights set on expansion, and the grooming team will be back working their magic across all eight peaks. White Heat will be getting a top-to-bottom makeover tonight, so head over to White Cap in the morning to sample the goods.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/winter-activities/night-skiing" target="_blank" title="activity" rel="noopener">Twilight skiing</a> is open on North Peak and South Ridge until 6:30 PM tonight, and be sure to check out <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/winter-activities/apres-aglow" target="_blank" title="activity" rel="noopener">Apres Aglow</a>, as well as a <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/tap-takeover-maine-beer-co" target="_blank" title="event" rel="noopener">Tap Takeover with Maine Beer Co</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Both hotels are now ski-in/ski-out for your convenience.
