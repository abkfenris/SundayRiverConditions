<h4><strong>January 7, 2023 | 6:35AM</strong></h4><h2><strong>Morning Update</strong><span></span></h2><p>It's finally Saturday morning, and we are excited for a great weekend ahead. Better get the coffee going, pack your bags up, and head up to the mountain today, as yesterday was a beautiful winter wonderland here at Sunday River.</p><p>Our Mountain Ops team was out through the night, making even more snow and grooming our trails smooth. Some snow guns will be on today, making snow on the top of Obsession at White Cap and parts of Excalibur at Jordan. The Snowcats stormed the mountain last night and were able to groom out the whole resort. They began at Jordan to push out, and smooth all the freshly made snow. The team then spread out to the rest of the resort to put down some fresh corduroy for the day ahead. Our Parks Crew got onto the mountain last night and finished building a top-to-bottom park for us all to enjoy at T72.</p><p>Today's weather will stay around the low 30s, with mild winds and clouds passing by throughout the day. Some signs of snow flurries are in the forecast, adding to the fun and bringing the winter vibes back to Sunday River.</p><p>If you on the hill today and itching to try somthing new head to White Cap from 8-2 for <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/indie-demo-day">Indie Demo day</a>.
