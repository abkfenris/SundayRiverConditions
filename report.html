<p><strong>November 21, 2022 | 7:20 AM</strong></p><p>Welcome to the first full week of operations for the 2022-23 season! This weekend was a ton of fun, and we're so glad to be back on snow. Mother Nature is in agreement and is throwing us another beautiful day to celebrate. It's a crisp morning here in Western Maine, with sunshine and warming throughout the day. The frigid temps last night allowed our snowmakers to refresh trails like Cascades and Right stuff with powdery goodness, and a lot of it. As if that news can't get better, snowmaking will be turned off on all currently open terrain so that we can focus on expansion. For today, expect fresh pressed corduroy on T2, Upper Sunday Punch, Ecstasy, Jungle Road, and Jim's Whim.</p><p>While our excellent Mountain Operations team has gotten most open terrain into mid-season condition already, pre-season conditions will continue to exist as we work on expanding our offerings. Please ski in control, and be aware of changing terrain. At this time, there is <strong>no beginner terrain</strong> available on the mountain. In addition to this,&nbsp;<strong>no uphill traffic is permitted at this time.</strong> Our team continues to work exceptionally hard to take advantage of the prolonged cold and open additional acreage as quickly as possible.</p><p>It's not too late to secure your <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/season-passes" title="Season Passes | Sunday River">New England Pass</a> or <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/ticket-packs">Maine Ticket Pack</a>. The wait is over for those looking to take advantage of Cyber Monday savings. We kicked off our biggest sale of the year early with up to 30% off lodging, and lift tickets from as low as $55. All the details can be <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/cyber-monday" title="Cyber Monday | Sunday River">found here</a>. Don't wait, holiday availability is filling up fast.&nbsp;</p><p>We'll see you out there!</p><p>&nbsp;- Team Snow</p><p></p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
