<p><strong>April 6, 2022</strong></p><p>Break out the tropical shirts, it's going to be a warm one today. Temps are expected to climb into the mid 50's, and with hardly any clouds in the sky, it's an excellent day to work on that goggle tan. Temps came down just low enough last night to allow our grooming team to work their magic across 60 trails from White Cap to North Peak. That also means that we'll be expecting a bountiful corn snow harvest to happen from roughly 10-1 today, and you do not want to miss that. Please note that all green terrain is only accessible from lift 7, the Chondola, or lift 2, the South Ridge Express. We'll see you out there!</p><p><a href="/blog/jordan-8-construction-begins" title="Construction Begins on the Jordan 8 Lift">Construction for the Jordan 8 has begun</a>! All uphill access is closed for terrain from Aurora Peak, Oz, Jordan Bowl, and trails serviced by Little White Cap Quad. Beginner terrain is exclusively located within South Ridge and North Peak. We've had an outstanding season skiing across all 8 peaks, and can't wait to continue next 2022-23 season!</p><p>Please note ski-in/ski-out access for the Grand Summit Hotel requires navigation of intermediate and advanced terrain. For the remainder of the 2021-22 season, please take the <a href="/shuttles-and-parking" title="Shuttle and Parking">Shuttle</a> to access other peaks from the Jordan Hotel.
