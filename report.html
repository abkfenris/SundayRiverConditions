<h4><strong>January 24, 2023 | 1:30 PM</strong></h4><h2><strong>Afternoon Report</strong><span></span></h2><p>Another excellent morning of skiing and riding is beginning to blend into another excellent afternoon on the slopes. The winds have begun to die down and clouds that are rolling through have brought a few flakes along with them. Temperatures are expected to stay in the mid-thirties this afternoon but will feel like it's closer to thirty degrees with the few remaining gusts of wind. Don't forget to throw that buff in your pocket to stay nice and toasty on your way back down.&nbsp;</p><p>Our Snowmaking team has been out on the hill keeping the snow guns running as long as the temps will allow and our grooming team is ready to take the baton after lifts stop spinning to reshape and lie down a fresh set of perfect stripes across the mountain. Tomorrow will kick off to a chilly start with temps in the teens, but will quickly warm to the mid-twenties mid-day. All eyes are on the forecast tomorrow evening as we prepare for the incoming third round of winter storms. Winter is back in Western Maine, and the skiing is superb!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;See you on the slopes!<br />-Team Snow</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
