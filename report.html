<h4><strong>February 4, 2023 |&nbsp;</strong></h4><h4><strong style="font-size: 2em;">Afternoon Report</strong></h4><p>Today certainly brought us our fair share of challenges, with wind gusts and cold temps making it difficult to run chair lifts. We did what we could to open what skiable terrain we could. Looking into tonight and tomorrow, the weather finally seems to be calming down. Temps will hit a low of around -5 tonight and will be just over 20 degrees by mid-day tomorrow. Although this is still pretty cold weather, it won't feel as chilly as today as the winds will calm down tonight and remain quiet for the rest of the weekend. The slight rise in temps and lack of wind should allow us to get back to our usual planned schedule and get our lifts and terrain back open for you to enjoy on this cold February weekend. Keep an eye on the Mountain Report for the most up-to-date lift and trail statuses.</p><p><span class="ui-provider ve b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z ab ac ae af ag ah ai aj ak" dir="ltr">As a reminder,&nbsp;<strong>Uphill Access is closed today, as is Night Skiing.</strong></span></p><p><span class="ui-provider ve b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z ab ac ae af ag ah ai aj ak" dir="ltr">Thank you all for your patience and understanding as we work through the challenges this weather presents.</span></p><p><span class="ui-provider ve b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z ab ac ae af ag ah ai aj ak" dir="ltr">Stay warm, and stay safe.</span></p><p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto;">-Team Snow</p><p></p><p></p><p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto;"><span style="color: #0e101a;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
