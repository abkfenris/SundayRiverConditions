<h4><strong>January 15, 2023 | 1:15 PM</strong></h4><h2><strong>Afternoon Update</strong><span></span></h2><p>As the weekend comes to an end, skiers and riders take advantage of the nice weather, getting in more runs and enjoying this beautiful Sunday. The clouds begin to roll in, but the sun peaks through, keeping visibility high throughout the resort.</p><p>Our team will return to work right after the last chair this afternoon to turn on the snowmakers and warm up the snowcats for another long night of hard work. They will be making snow on closed trails all over our eight peaks, with plans for trail expansion in the near future. Cats will get to the rest of the mountain to groom out any bumps, break up firm spots and redraw those Sunday River stripes onto all open terrain.</p><p>Tomorrow will bring average temps ranging in the 20s, with a few clouds coming through and mild winds. Mother nature may treat us with some natural snow in the upcoming days, something we can all get excited about. We hope you have a good rest of your MLK weekend and can enjoy some runs with us here in the heart of western Maine.</p><p>&nbsp;See you up there!<br />-Team Snow</p><p><strong>UPDATE:</strong>&nbsp; Barker Mountain Lodge will be open with LIMITED services this morning.&nbsp; The lodge may be accessed for use of the main restrooms and locker rooms, but the kitchen, bar, and handicap restroom are not available at this time.&nbsp; Thank you for your patience as we work to restore full services.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
