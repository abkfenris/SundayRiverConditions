Afternoon Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: March 23, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 1:48 PM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>We have officially received a foot of snow from this March snowstorm, and we couldn't be happier. The snow is still falling, and the powder keeps coming. Throughout the day today, we've opened almost 100 acres, and it should keep snowing until tonight. Who doesn't love a good powder day? We sure do.&nbsp;</p><p>Our snowmaking team will let Mother Nature lead the charge tonight, and they'll be off of the hill. Our grooming team will work to pack down some of this new snow, but powder hounds, never fear: they'll be doing a narrow groom on some of the more advanced terrain tonight to preserve those powder stashes on the sides. South Ridge, North Peak, and Lower White Cap will all be groomed last to pack down as much powder as possible on our beginner terrain. Excalibur will remain ungroomed. Please note that as this storm moves through the area, we are expecting some higher winds tomorrow. Keep an eye on the lift and trail status below for the most updated information.&nbsp;</p><p>Thinking about a season pass for next year? Buy now, ski now has officially started.
