Morning Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: January 22, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 7:25 AM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>Good morning and happy Monday. We've got another day of amazing conditions coming your way, so let's get into it. Temps are forecasted to reach the low 20s up high, with some partly cloudy skies, and decent wind gusts througout the day. And speaking of wind, we are getting a few strong gusts that could impact operations. At the time of this report, we haven't heard anything to indicate lift holds, but we will continue to update the lift statuses if anything changes.</p><p>Groomers got to work last night tackling their normal slate of trails, as well as smoothing out American Express and Upper Sunday Punch. Snowmaking continues across the resort and will keep pushing as temps allow to get those last few trails open. Conditions across the board have been superb, so we expect that to continue into this week. Definitely a great time to come out and make some midweek turns.</p><p>This coming week is Senior Week, and we have a whole list of events, including a Cinabun Social, musical bingo, a comedy show, and karaoke. Find all of the details on our <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/senior-week" title="Senor Week | Sunday River, Maine">Senior Week</a> event page.
