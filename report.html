Afternoon Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: January 31, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 1:42 PM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>With a bright sky, temps in the high twenties, and snow perfect for carving, today was a great day. We had a mix of groomed terrain and powdery snowmaking, so there was something for everyone. An excellent day for some midweek turns.&nbsp;</p><p>Our snowmaking team will be at it again tonight, with White Heat high on the priority list. They'll keep making snow on Rocking Chair in preparation for the terrain park and boardercross build, and they'll also resurface areas on Kansas and Monday Mourning. Our grooming team will be out as usual, and in addition to the standard trails, they'll be working in the snowmaking piles from today on Cascades.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/pride-weekend" title="Pride Weekend | Sunday River, Maine">Pride Weekend</a> is this weekend, and there are events for everyone to enjoy. <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/presidents-week" title="Presidents' Week | Sunday River, Maine">Presidents' Week</a> is right around the corner, with fun in store for the whole family.
