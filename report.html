<p><strong>February 3, 2022</strong></p><p>Soft turns were the name of the game today, but tonight is a different story. This afternoon's rain is forecasted to change over to snow later this evening, and <strong>we're expecting up to a foot of snow or more</strong> through Friday afternoon. With over 800 acres of skiable terrain across all eight peaks, you better pack your powder skis and boards. We're in for a doozy! The grooming team will be hiting the usual suspects tonight, but are leaving Excalibur, Rogue Angel, Right Stuff, South Paw, and Obsession au naturale for extra fun on the slopes tomorrow. We'll see you for first chair at 9AM.&nbsp;</p><p>Please note that ski-in access to the Jordan Hotel requires the navigation of intermediate trails to reach Jordan Bowl.</p><p><strong>Around the Resort</strong></p><p>OutRyders is partnering with Sunday River to bring you <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/pride-weekend.xml" title="event listing">Pride Weekend</a> this February 4-6!
