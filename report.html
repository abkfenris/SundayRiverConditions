<h4><strong>April 20, 2023 | 11:05 AM</strong><strong></strong></h4><h4><strong style="font-size: 2em;">Weekend Update</strong></h4><p>Well, folks, it's been one heck of a season, and we couldn't thank you all enough for being a part of it. We still have one more weekend left to get some spring turns in, so let's get into it.</p><p>For this weekend, we'll be ripping it up in Jordan. Skiing and riding will be off of the Jordan 8, with ski-in, ski-out access at the Jordan Hotel, and food service available on the Sliders Deck. The warm temps have definitely taken a lot of snow from our slopes, but word on the block is that the Jordan Bowl is in great shape. We are planning to have top-to-bottom skiing on Lollapalooza, Rogue Angel, and Excalibur, with the chance for more depending on coverage. Due to late-season conditions, <strong>there will be no beginner terrain available</strong>.</p><p>Parking will be available in the Jordan overflow lot, located just before the main hotel entrance as you're traveling up the access road.</p><p>Please note that <strong>all uphill access is closed at this time</strong>. We are rolling straight into summer construction, and this means that there is a lot of equipment on the mountain. For everyone's safety, please respect this closure.</p><p>Any updates between now and Saturday will be posted here, so keep an eye out for the latest info! Have a great rest of the week!</p><p>-Team Snow</p><p></p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
