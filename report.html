<h4><strong>December 17, 2022 | 1:34 PM&nbsp;</strong></h4><h2><strong>Afternoon Update</strong></h2><p>Good afternoon skiers and riders, the amount of snow we received last night was ridiculous, but it didn't stop there. It kept coming down this morning and into the day, totaling around 24" in the last 24 hours. Despite some electrical issues due to the storm this morning, it was a great day to be on the hill, with ropes dropping left and right. We are actively working with Central Maine Power to wrap up any loose ends, with progress going well.&nbsp;</p><p>For this evening, our <a href="/events/winterfest-weekend">Winterfest Weekend</a> calendar has gotten some updates, due to the weather. We've made the decision for the safety of all involved that our annual torchlight parade will be postponed. In addition to this, our first night of Twilight Skiing will happen, but we will only be skiing and riding under the lights off of the South Ridge Express. The Chondola will not be open for Twilight Skiing to allow our operations team the space to get the mountain cleaned up for tomorrow.</p><p>This storm was exactly what we needed to start building a solid snow base in hopes of opening up more terrain soon. The Mountain Ops team will get out tonight to groom beginner terrain and inspect the rest of the mountain for trail expansion. Tomorrow is forecasted for mild winter temps, calm winds, and partly cloudy skies. The snowfall is beginning to slow down, giving plows plenty of time to get out there and provide a safe drive for tomorrow. It's truly shaping up to be one of the best days all year, with wall-to-wall hero snow, so make sure you don't miss out on the fun.&nbsp;</p><p>We will see you out there!</p><p>-Team Snow</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
