<h4><strong>January 21, 2023 | 1:15 PM</strong></h4><h2><strong>Afternoon Report</strong><span></span></h2><p>It is another beautiful sunny day here at the mountain. Blue skies and fresh groomers as far as the eye can see. The snow conditions are amazing as this freshly packed snow covered previous firm spots and kept its shape as the day went on.</p><p>Going into the night, our Mountain Ops team will be back to it, hard at work once again. They will leave the snow guns running overnight on trails such as White Heat, Salvation, Rocking Chair, Wildfire, Bear Paw, and a few others around the resort. These trails will open once we get enough snow on them and give them a thorough grooming, hopfully in the near future. Groomers will start on open terrain tonight, drawing those beautiful stripes back onto the trail. They will then head to closed terrain to see if there is anything they can smooth out and prepare to open up.</p><p>The weather tomorrow looks like another fantastic day for any winter activity as temps range from 10-30 degrees, winds will remain calm, and the sun will peak through partially cloudy skies as the day goes on.</p><p>We hope you can get out here and enjoy the over 700 acres of open terrain we have to offer.<br />Stay safe, and have a fantastic rest of your weekend!<br />-Team Snow</p><p>&nbsp;</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
