Morning Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: April 8, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 7:30 AM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>This might be the most beautiful morning of the year! The sun is out, the skies are clear, and the snow is warming up. This has all the makings of a great ski day and the best weather to view a solar eclipse!&nbsp;</p><p>White Cap Quad will be open for ski-in/ski-out access to the Grand Summit Hotel. Please keep in mind that there is no green terrain to get back to the hotel. The suggested route to get back to the Grand Summit is from Jibe, to Heats On, to lower Starlight.</p><p>Today, White Cap Quad, Barker 6, Chondola (ski lane), Spruce Peak Triple, and Jordan 8 will shut down at 3PM for the eclipse. The Chondola will remain open until 3:20PM for foot traffic up to North Peak. At 3:45PM, the Chondola will reopen to download those who purchased scenic lift rides. All other lifts will reopen at 4PM and close for the day at 5PM, except for Spruce which will stop spinning at 4:45PM.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://shop.sundayriver.com/s/events/p/solar-eclipse">Scenic lift tickets</a> off the Chondola can be purchased online or at the Welcome Center in South Ridge until 2PM. We are expecting traffic, so if you are arriving later in the day and want to watch from the mountain, give yourself a little extra time to get here. The <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/shuttles-and-parking">resort shuttle</a> will run from 8AM-6PM from the hotels and parking lots.&nbsp;</p><p>We are havinga party at North Peak with the <a href="https://mainemineralmuseum.org/" title="MMGM">Maine Gem and Mineral museum</a>! They will be hosting a raffle, and letting people hold a piece of the moon - yes, the actual moon! North Peak will be open for food and drinks, so why not get up there a little early and spend some extra time on the patio.&nbsp;</p><p>If anything changes between now and the eclipse, we'll update the Mountain Report with more most current information.</p><p>As a reminder, all new <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/season-passes">New England Passes</a> automatically qualify for immediate access all Spring long, so buy now, ski now, and maximize the value of your pass now!</p><p>We'll see you out there!</p><p>- Team Snow</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
