<h4><strong>April 5, 2023 |&nbsp; 2:20 PM</strong><strong></strong></h4><h4><strong style="font-size: 2em;">Afternoon Report</strong></h4><p>It's firm, fast, and fun out there today.&nbsp; Temps have crawled into the mid 30's this afternoon but the light winds have kept the feel closer to the mid 20's. The cloud cover has been persistent and only just recently began to darken with a few less-than-frozen bits of precipitation coming down now. The weather overnight does not look like it will be our favorite kind, but our team is ready for anything mother nature throws our way. Fresh cord will be waiting for you in the morning and it looks like spring will be making its return tomorrow afternoon as temps head back up into the 50's.&nbsp;</p><p>If you're looking to get over to Jordan from South Ridge, ski on over to Spruce Peak Triple and take Sirus &gt; Aludra &gt; Cyclone &gt; State Fair. Kansas will bring you back from Jordan to South Ridge when you're ready to head back East.&nbsp; Please note that in order to access condos off of Ridge Run, you must<strong> take Dream Maker and then turn onto Ridge Run</strong>. We have operations on 3D cutting over the Ridge Run road and cannot have thru-traffic.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>We have a lot still going on here at Sunday River; as we wind down the season be sure to check out our <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/spring.xml" title="Spring Operation Schedule">Spring operations schedule</a> and end-of-season<a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events"> events</a>.
