<h4><strong>March 2, 2023 | 7:30 AM</strong></h4><h4><strong style="font-size: 2em;">Morning Report</strong></h4><p>Good morning fellow snow lovers. It was a fantastic sight to wake up to falling snow once again. The forecasted snowfall for today has already begun, and we are looking at 3-6" by the end of the day, only to add to the fun.</p><p>Groomers took to the slopes early last night to mow down any mogul fields and skied out areas after a terrific day yesterday. If this storm continues, these smooth corduroy trails should have a nice little dusting on top by the first chair. It's shaping up to be a great day of skiing and riding here in western Maine. With fresh snow groomed into the surface and more snow coming, our eight peaks and over 800 acres of open terrain are in excellent condition for all to enjoy.</p><p>We are starting the morning in the high 20s and up to the low 30s for the rest of the day. Pack your low-light lenses or maybe just your safety glasses from the shed because it's snowy, cloudy, and the visibility is reasonably low this morning. Will March continue to provide the goods we are always looking for with more snow on its way?</p><p>Let's hope it's not over yet!<br />-Team Snow</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
