<h4><strong>January 2, 2023 | 1:29 PM&nbsp;</strong></h4><h2><strong>Afternoon Update</strong><span></span></h2><p>Monday's, am I right. Thank you all for your patience while we got all possible lifts spinning. Currently, Jordan 8 and North Peak Express are open and loading. We do not anticipate White Heat quad opening due to the ski conditions off of Obsession, but will certainly update the Mountain Report if anything changes.&nbsp;</p><p>Today's conditions skied pretty similarly to the last couple days, but we welcomed the sounds of snow guns firing away across the peaks. Temps look slightly more favorable coming up, and our snowmaking team will be looking to take advantage of the weather windows that we get. It hasn't been the season anyone wanted, but it's the season we got, and we're going to make the most of it.</p><p>&nbsp;-Team Snow</p><p><b>UPDATED Uphill Policy</b><span>: Uphill travel is NOT</span><span>&nbsp;permitted until further notice.&nbsp;</span></p><p></p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
