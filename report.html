Afternoon Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: February 26, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 1:55 PM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>We loved seeing that bluebird sky for a while this afternoon! The sun poking out really made for an excellent day on the hill. The snow's definitely running on the fast and firm side, so if you felt yourself getting a little too fast and loose out there, our<a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/equipment-tuning" title="Equipment Tuning"> tune shop</a> can set you right up.&nbsp;</p><p>Looking ahead temps look kind of warm for the upcoming stretch, so it's unlikely we'll see snowmaking fire up. Fortunately, we've got a lot of manmade snow to work with and our groomers will get back on the hill tonight to buff it all out. Even with no snow in the forecast, we've got loads of terrain across all 8 peaks.</p><p>It's never a bad time to review the Skier Responsibility Code. Take a moment, refresh yourself before heading out, and please remember to go slow in the base areas.</p><p>Have you looked at the new apr&egrave;s experience at the Alpeniglu at Sunday River? On Saturdays throughout the season, take a PistenBully cabin cat down to the igloo from Sliders and enjoy some sweets, drinks, and music, before taking the cat back up. <a href="https://shop.sundayriver.com/s/events/p/cat-ride-igloo-experience" title="Apres Experience | Sunday River, Maine">Tickets</a> are on sale now.&nbsp;</p><p>We'll see you out there!</p><p>- Team Snow</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
