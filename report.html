<p><strong>December 3, 2022 | 7:00 AM</strong></p><p>It's looking like a classic New England ski day today, with soft corduroy and overcast skies forecast throughout the morning. Our snowmaking and grooming teams worked tirelessly overnight to get all open terrain perfectly groomed and ready for the weekend. After pushing snow all over South Ridge, beginner terrain is now available off of the South Ridge Express, but with four open peaks to choose from, there is plenty of terrain for all levels. The snow will soften up even more with comfortable temperatures ahead as the day continues.
