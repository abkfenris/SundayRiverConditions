Catch a few more runs before the lifts stop spinning at 4PM. Many of our naturals have opened up over the course of the day, so check out the trail list below to see what you may have missed this morning. Or, if your legs are all burned out, might I suggest deck beer at <a href="/resort-dining/shipyard-brew-haus">Shipyard</a>, the <a href="/resort-dining/foggy-goggle">Goggle</a>, or <a href="/resort-dining/barker-bar">Barker Bar</a>? 'Tis the season of apr&egrave;s. If you weren't able to join us this weekend, I highly encourage you to find some time this coming week. We're in for some sunny weather again tomorrow, and lifts open at 9AM. See you on the slopes!</p><div><p>With operations open daily through April 24, there is plenty of ski season ahead.
