Morning Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: February 23, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 6:35 AM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>We're in for another warmer day on the mountain, with temps in the low to mid-thirties across the resort. We received 1" of new snow last night, and a few flakes are still falling. We have over 715 acres of open terrain today, and 17 scheduled lifts. Who's up for first chair?</p><p>Snowmaking went on pause last night with the higher temperatures, and they'll be back online as soon as the temps drop. Our grooming team took care of all of our normally groomed trails. White Heat, Ecalibur, and Lollapalooza all had the new snow groomed in last night, and those trails should cruise well today. The Aurora Quad will remain on hold following a mechanical issue. Due to that, the Jordan Mountain Double and the Quantum Leap Triple will open at 8AM this morning, instead of their usual 9AM. Lower Airglow, Celestial, and Supernova will be closed, but Northern Lights, Lower Vortex, Paradigm, and Sensation will remain open.&nbsp;</p><p>It's never a bad time to review the Skier Responsibility Code. Take a moment, refresh yourself before heading out, and please remember to go slow in the base areas.</p><p><a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/presidents-week" title="Presidents' Week | Sunday River, Maine">Presidents' Week</a> is continuing, and our events schedule remains jam-packed.
