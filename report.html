<p><strong>March 11, 2022</strong></p><p>Serene skiing on striped slopes! Carve-in to start your weekend with more than 80 groomed trails in preparation for the incoming snow tomorrow. Forecasts are calling for totals ranging 6-14&rdquo; starting tomorrow and we couldn&rsquo;t be more excited. Like many storms, we could see some wind at the end of its run, so we've removed the cabins off the Chondola for the weekend. Also, the winds aren't supposed to arrive until the end of the storm, so if you're planning in enjoying the fresh snow, tomorrow is definitely going to be the day. We'll keep you posted if anything changes (which it always does).&nbsp;</p><p>Tonight, groomers are putting down a beautiful corduroy base for all the fresh Saturday snow. Catch the flurries flying across the peaks at 8AM first chair. You can take runs across the mountain until the sun goes down with all-day lifts spinning until 4PM, then head to North Peak for <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/winter-activities/night-skiing.xml" title="Twilight Skiing">Twilight Skiing</a> until 6:30PM.
