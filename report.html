<h4><strong>March 29, 2023 | 7:32 AM</strong><strong></strong></h4><h4><strong style="font-size: 2em;">Morning Report</strong></h4><p>It is an absolutely beautiful morning, and it's got us stoked on another day of skiing under the sunshine. Cold temps last night made for excellent grooming conditions, and they sure took advantage. Trails will begin the day a little firm, but will quickly soften up into that oh-so-fun spring skiing. No matter what your flavor, it should be a wonderful day on the slopes.</p><p>It may almost be April, but we've still got plenty of amazing skiing and great events coming up to keep you entertained. This weekend is <a href="/events/spring-fest-weekend" title="Spring Fest">Spring Fest</a> over at White Cap. The party starts Friday night and goes through Sunday afternoon, and definitely shouldn't be missed.</p><p>It's going to be an amazing spring, so why not ski or ride <strong>for free</strong>?
