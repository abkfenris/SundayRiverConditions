Afternoon Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: January 26, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 1:01 PM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>By now, there's about 4" of snow at the base, and it should keep falling for a few more hours. Temps kept steady in the low twenties up top and low thirties at the bottom, with little to no wind. It was a great way to head into the weekend.&nbsp;</p><p>Our snowmaking team will take another night for some routine maintenance, and they're hoping to turn the guns back on sometime Sunday afternoon, temperature permitting. They've been working hard out there, and it shows with our 776 acres of open terrain. Our grooming team is back to our standard list of groomed trails, and they'll be adding Merrill Hill terrain to that lineup tonight, as well. They'll be working this new snow into corduroy for us on our groomed terrain, but be sure to check out our natural terrain for some powder stashes tomorrow. Lower T72 will also open in the morning, with a total of 21 features.&nbsp;</p><p>Our next&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/eddy-and-betty-dinner-jan-27"><strong>Eddy &amp; Betty Dinner</strong></a> is tomorrow, so don't miss this chance to hang out with your favorite Yetis and enjoy a host of fun activities.
