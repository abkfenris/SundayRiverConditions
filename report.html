Afternoon Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: February 29, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 1:20 PM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>9:30AM Update: All uphill routes are closed today.&nbsp;</p><p>It's pretty blustery out there today, as a weather system moves through the area. The good news is that the winds will die down tonight as the system moves on, and tomorrow should be business as usual. As always, be sure to check out the lift, trail, and uphill status below for the most up-to-date information throughout the day.&nbsp;</p><p>Our snowmaking team is back on the hill, and the Broadway fans are online and running. The snowmaking team is anticipating running the snowguns on a few more trails throughout the night, as well. Our grooming team is planning on laying stripes on about 80 trails tonight, including White Heat, Airglow, Right Stuff, and Tempest. The parks team will be resetting features on T72 tomorrow, as well.&nbsp;</p><p>Tomorrow's forecast has us looking forward to temperatures in the mid-thirties, light winds, and sunny skies. Hit the slopes to work on those goggle tans, and then stay after the sun sets for some twilight skiing.
