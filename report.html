<h4><strong>January 1, 2023 | 6:35 AM</strong></h4><h2><strong>Morning Update</strong><span></span></h2><p>Good morning Sunday River, and happy new year. Can you think of a better way to start your year than a couple of laps on this fine Sunday? With over 350 acres of open terrain and temps in the low 40s, we are as excited as you are to get on the hill and kick off the new year.</p><p>As clouds passed through early this morning, slight precipitation occurred but remained at a drizzle. This weather has already come and gone, only to soften the freshly groomed snow even more as temps remain mild.</p><p>Our Mountain ops team got out and groomed last night and early this morning on most of the mountain, leaving some intermediate trails alone to provide variety and maintain some of our snowpack.</p><p>Ungroomed terrain includes Obsession, T2, Right Stuff, Sunday Punch, Air Glow, Rogue Angel, and Excalibur. Other trails may be partially groomed but will have corduroy all the way down. Be sure to check the mountain report throughout the day for trail statuses as ski patrol inspects the quality and safety of the terrain.</p><p>We hope you are enjoying the last days of the holidays and can make it up today for more soft turns and warm temps.</p><p>&nbsp;We will see you out there!<br />-Team Snow</p><p><b>UPDATED Uphill Policy</b><span>: Uphill travel is NOT</span><span>&nbsp;permitted until further notice.&nbsp;</span></p><p></p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
