<h4><strong>December 31, 2022 | 6:35 AM</strong></h4><h2><strong>Morning Update</strong><span></span></h2><p>The sun is just starting to rise over the mountains, a beautiful start to new years eve. Lifts are beginning to spin, and our team is making their way to their positions. Snowcats took to the hill overnight to groom out and smooth all open terrain on the mountain. Our team will open up 16 lifts and 60 trails today for plenty of terrain for everyone.</p><p>If you're looking to challenge yourself today, the White Heat Quad is up and running and will provide access to Obsession. This black diamond is the only ungroomed trail on the mountain, and we heard it was skiing great the last few days.</p><p>The weather is warm and mild once again as this warm front sticks around for a few more days. Clouds should pass by throughout the day, but visibility will stay reasonable, and these warm temps will undoubtedly keep the snow soft.</p><p>It's your last chance to get some runs in during 2022, but there is still plenty of skiing and riding to kick off your 2023 season.
