<h4><strong>January 26, 2023 | 7:30 AM</strong></h4><h4><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h4><strong style="font-size: 2em;">Morning Report</strong></h4><p>Good morning skiers and riders; last night was exactly what we were looking for, as the snow kept falling from mid-afternoon until early this morning. We received about 6" of fresh snow here at the base of South Ridge, with more of this fresh pow pow at higher elevations. The storm has calmed down as the morning has gone on and will be reasonably mild throughout the day. Don't forget to pack a few lens options today, as clouds will stick around and pass by as the day goes on. Temps will reach up to the mid to high 30s just before the last chair, and winds will be moderate at moments in the day.</p><p>Mountain Ops turned off the snow guns last night to let Mother Nature do its thing, and the grooming team was out on the resort for the night, making passes all over our eight peaks. They mixed in any of the made snow piles from recent days and created groomed terrain options from the top of all peaks for today. They began this morning on South Ridge and North Peak grooming perfect sunday river stripes back onto all beginner terrain.</p><p>Due to warmer temps early this morning, there is a slight crust on top of this fresh snow. Nothing that won't be broken up with ease after a few turns this morning. However, please be cautious skiing untouched terrain today as snow conditions will vary through the resort. Ski Patrol will be out this morning, exploring our terrain and inspecting trail quality. Keep an eye on the snow report throughout the day as they begin to drop more ropes and open new terrain.</p><p>Winter has arrived!<br />-Team Snow</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
