Morning Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: December 31, 2023 </strong></em><strong>| 6:54 AM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>Happy New Year's Eve, Sunday River!&nbsp;</p><p>Today we can expect partly cloudy skies and temps in the mid-twenties to low-thirties. We have a similar lineup of terrain today, with 26 open trails and seven lifts.&nbsp;</p><p>Last night, our snowmaking team went back to business. Temperatures finally allowed our snowmaking system to come back online, and our team was making snow all throughout the night and into today. They're planning on running those snow guns until temperatures say otherwise, and colder weather is forecasted over the next couple of days. There will be no snowmaking on open terrain today, but our snowmaking system will remain active on closed terrain. Our grooming team was out through the night as well, giving all of our open terrain a clean-up and some fresh stripes.</p><p>Somehow 2024 is already right around the corner. Join us in celebrating tonight with our New Year's Eve event lineup. We have extended twilight skiing until 8PM, a kids-only party, a <a href="https://shop.sundayriver.com/s/events/p/foggy-goggle-new-years-eve-party" title="Foggy Goggle New Year's Eve Party | Sunday River, Maine">21+ party</a>, and more.

Upon further evaluation, the Chondola will remain closed Sunday, December 31, but is tentatively planned to re-open on Monday, January 1.</p><p>Looking ahead, our goal is to be skiing in the Jordan Bowl on Friday, January 5. This will include ski-in, ski-out access to the Jordan Hotel. The Alpeniglu is also scheduled to re-open on Friday, as well as the Outpost, for convenient slopeside snacks and beverages. Snowmaking temps will be crucial to meeting this goal, but the forecast looks promising, and our snowmakers are ready to get back to what they do best.</p><p>Think cold, and we'll see you out there!</p><p>- Team Snow</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
