</p><p style="color: #696969; font-weight: 900; font-size: 12px;">WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 10</p><div><p>We had a beautiful dusting of snow yesterday, setting us up for a blissful Wednesday on the mountain. Conditions have been sweet all week, with options for carving up the groomers, slipping through the trees, and park riding. Lifts open at 9AM and I hope I see some early birds this morning!&nbsp;<span>Catch the fresh corduroy, take in the views, and you&rsquo;re bound to start your day on a high note. The mountain is now 100% open, so make sure you're taking runs all across our eight peaks.</span>&nbsp;There may be a little more snow in the forecast coming this weekend, so start snow dancing tonight!&nbsp;</p><p>Looking ahead to the holiday, we have quite the line-up for <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/presidents-week">Presidents' Day Weekend</a> and week. Keep in mind lift tickets are limited and days are already selling out, so plan ahead if you want to hit the slopes next week. Or <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/booklodging">book lodging</a> with us and guarantee access to full-day lift tickets.&nbsp;</p><p><span>Please note that kids ski school lessons are now available to <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/lessons/kids-lessons" target="_blank" rel="noopener">book online&nbsp;</a>with limited availability.</span></p><p><span>We are&nbsp;</span><a title="Online Store" href="https://shop.sundayriver.com/s/lift-tickets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>requiring online lift ticket purchase</strong></a><span>&nbsp;and setting </span><strong>limits on the number of tickets</strong><span>&nbsp;sold for each day. This includes full-day, half-day, beginner, Threedom additional days, and Passholder Friend tickets. We only expect these limits to affect peak dates, but encourage everyone to buy early to ensure access on the dates you want. Season passes, Ikon passes, and lift ticket packs remain direct-to-lift with no restrictions or reservations.</span></p><p><span>Fast and contactless lift ticket pickup is available at our PUBs (Pick Up Boxes) at base lodges and hotels. Just scan the barcode at the bottom of your confirmation email and your RFID cards will print with your lift tickets or ticket packs loaded. For best results turn off dark mode on your phone if you use it and avoid email apps that use dark backgrounds.</span></p><p><span>Please remember to take a self-administered </span><a title="Health Screening" href="https://www.sundayriver.com/covid">Health Screening</a><span> and visit our&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/covid">COVID Winter Guide</a><span>&nbsp;before each trip to stay up-to-date on safety protocols and state guidelines.</span></p><p>Point 'em downhill!</p><p><span>Team Snow</span></p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
