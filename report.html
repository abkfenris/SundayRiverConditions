<p><strong>December 16, 2022 | 7:35 AM</strong></p><p>The snow dance must have worked as this morning's flurries start sticking to the ground. With snow in the forecast for the entire day, it's looking like a beautiful Friday here at Sunday River. Snowfall should pick up in the afternoon, and winds should stay calm all day. The groomers were able to get out there last night and smooth out all open terrain. These soft corduroy laps will only get better as the new-fallen snow creates a playful layer on top. The team was hard at work last night, opening up more beginner terrain at South Ridge, and we will look forward to a significant expansion of open trails after this weekend.</p><p>If you're out of sick days at work and won't make it here until tomorrow, you're in luck because this snowfall is sticking around. We are expecting another 5-8 inches tonight and more throughout the day tomorrow. With over 150 acres of open terrain there will be plenty of fresh turns out there for everyone.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;Drive safe, and we will see you out there!<br />-Team Snow</p><p></p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
