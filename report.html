<h4><strong>January 1, 2023 | 1:25 PM&nbsp;</strong></h4><h2><strong>Afternoon Update</strong><span></span></h2><p>The snow was soft like mashed potatoes today but with a bit of added corn thrown in some parts. Skiing was playful and fun. Side hits and mogul lines were a plenty as this heavier snow built up quickly. Temps were mild for the day; however, winds forced us to delay the opening of a few lifts.</p><p>Our Mountain Ops team will be hard at work overnight, making snow throughout the resort and filling areas that need a little TLC. They will be at it early morning, grooming out open terrain in preparation for the week ahead. As the season progresses, we are constantly working to improve and grow our available terrain. Let's hope Mother Nature can show us a little love in the upcoming weeks, and we can continue to open more trails for skiing and riding.</p><p>Happy New Year!<br />&nbsp;-Team Snow</p><p><b>UPDATED Uphill Policy</b><span>: Uphill travel is NOT</span><span>&nbsp;permitted until further notice.&nbsp;</span></p><p></p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
