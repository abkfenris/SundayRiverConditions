Afternoon Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: March 17, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 1:18 PM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>Well, today was a bit of a damp one. The precipitation was mostly of the unfrozen variety, with some flurries up top. The clouds should mostly clear up by tomorrow morning, and tomorrow should be mostly sunny, with temps in the mid to high thirties; perfect for some midweek turns.&nbsp;</p><p>We have 13 lifts scheduled for tomorrow, and our grooming team will be laying stripes on a similar list of trails as last night, except for Merrill Hill. All of our green terrain, most of our blue terrain, and some of our advanced terrain will be groomed. We'll also have natural, ungroomed terrain open, including Lost Princess, Blind Ambition, and Last Tango. Please note that Three Mile Trail will be ungroomed tomorrow.&nbsp;</p><p>Looking at season passes for next season? Buy now, ski now has officially started.
