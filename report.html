<h4><strong>March 11, 2023 | 6:30 AM</strong><strong></strong></h4><h4><strong style="font-size: 2em;">Morning Report</strong></h4><p>Good morning skiers and riders. Saturday has finally arrived, and it's going to be another fantastic day out on the slopes. Groomers did their thing overnight, putting stripes on the ground all over the mountain. Temps will warm up to the high 30s as the day goes on, so things will start out firm and fast but eventually soften up as the sun loosens the top surface.</p><p>To celebrate 25 years of safely caring for and transporting the people of Maine, Lifeflight of Maine is visiting today. Ski over to the Jordan 8 base From 12 pm-1 pm to take a closer look at a Lifeflight helicopter and say hello to the crew that makes it all happen.</p><p>We are running and operating all our lifts this weekend, allowing you to easily explore the over 800 acres of open terrain we have to offer. Please note that Lollapalooza will be closed for a race event today until around 10 am. It's looking like another great weekend here in western Maine. Why not take advantage of the nice weather and take a few laps with us?
