<p><strong>November 30, 2022 | 7:38 AM</strong></p><p>A coating to 1" of snow blanketed the mountain through the early morning, and while it isn't quite the storm we're looking for, seeing the mountain in all white is a sight for sore eyes. Snowmaking continued their push overnight, with temps dropping into the mid-20s. The groomers also took to the hill and, even by their lofty standards, worked some magic, putting fresh stripes down on all open terrain. The flakes are still flying, and it's looking like a lovely morning to be on the hill. We're keep an eye on unsettled weather moving in this afternoon, so keep an eye here for all of the updates.</p><p>Today is the final chance to take advantage of our huge Cyber Week savings.
