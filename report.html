Morning Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: December 30, 2023 </strong></em><strong>| 6:48 AM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>An inch of natural snow on the ground is a great sight to see on the mountain this morning. Today, we&rsquo;ll have temps in the low to mid-thirties with a decent cloud cover. Although it didn&rsquo;t quite get cold enough for snowmaking last night, it&rsquo;s coming soon. Today we have 25 trails and seven lifts. All open terrain got a fresh groom last night, and according to our grooming team, these are the best stripes of the past couple of days.</p><p><span>We truly appreciate everyone's kindness and patience during the construction process as we work to repair damage from last week's storm</span>. There will be no active construction at South Ridge today, nor will there be active construction on Outta Here or Lower Lazy River.</p><p>Today, head over to the Jordan Spa for a <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/sip-and-sweets" title="Sips &amp; Sweets | Sunday River, Maine">Sips &amp; Sweets</a> event. Browse the boutique and get to know the spa team while enjoying some complimentary prosecco from 4-6PM.

Access will be via the Spruce Peak Triple to Sirius, Aludra, then Light's Out.</p><p>In addition to the Peak Lodge opening, we are planning to open the Chondola tomorrow, December 31. As construction wraps up in South Ridge and snowmaking comes back online, we are expecting to load the gondola cabins only for the first few days.</p><p>Looking ahead, our goal is to be skiing in the Jordan Bowl on Friday, January 5. This will include ski-in, ski-out access to the Jordan Hotel. The Alpeniglu is also scheduled to re-open on Friday, as well as the Outpost, for convenient slopeside snacks and beverages. Snowmaking temps will be crucial to meeting this goal, but the forecast looks promising, and our snowmakers are raring to get back to what they do best.</p><p>Thank you to everyone who has supported Sunday River through this recovery process. We wouldn&rsquo;t be here without everyone who helped.</p><p>We'll see you out there!</p><p>- Team Snow</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
