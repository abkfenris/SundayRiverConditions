Afternoon Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: March 28, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 1:18 PM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>It might still be a little cloudy, but the rain of this morning let up around 11AM, and the turns are soft and lovely. The inverted temperatures flipped by noon, and it's currently in the mid-forties in the base areas. We're expecting similar temperatures tomorrow, with cloudy skies and the potential for some breeze.&nbsp;</p><p>Due to the precipitation last night and this morning, as well as the warmer temperatures, our grooming team will be following a limited grooming plan to preserve the snowpack. The terrain on South Ridge and Little White Cap will be groomed, and one trail off of every lift will be groomed. Otherwise, tomorrow will be some true spring skiing. We'll have a final list of groomed terrain tomorrow. Check out the lift and trail status below for the most up-to-date information. White Heat will also be closed through the weekend for Bust 'N' Burn.&nbsp;</p><p>Thinking about a season pass for next year? Buy now, ski now has officially started.
