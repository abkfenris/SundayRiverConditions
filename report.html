<p><strong>November 20, 2022 | 1:07 PM</strong></p><p>If you ask us, that was worth the wait. Conditions throughout the day have been fabulous, and Mother Nature even came through with a surprise dusting. Snowmaking will continue throughout the night, with all sights set on expansion. Grooming will be limited to the same trails as last night, with fresh cord going down on Upper Sunday Punch, T2, Ecstasy, Jungle Road, and Jim's Whim. This delay in lower mountain grooming allows the snow we've made to cure, which in turn allows our groomers to work their magic and deliver the best conditions possible.&nbsp;</p><p>In the meantime, pre-season conditions will continue to exist as we work on expanding our offerings. Please ski in control, and be aware of changing terrain. At this time, there is <strong>no beginner terrain</strong> available on the mountain. In addition to this,&nbsp;<strong>no uphill traffic is permitted at this time.</strong> Our team continues to work exceptionally hard to take advantage of the prolonged cold and open additional acreage as quickly as possible.</p><p>It's not too late to secure your <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/season-passes" title="Season Passes | Sunday River">New England Pass</a> or <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/ticket-packs">Maine Ticket Pack</a>.
