We are preparing to open Jordan this morning as the sun rises over the distant mountains and peeks through the clouds. It's currently 37 degrees at Jordan top, with high temperatures today reaching 45 up top and 52 down low.</p><p>All Skiing and Riding will be from the Jordan 8. Head over to the Jordan Hotel for all trail access. The lower parking lot is right on the trail, making it a breeze to boot up at your car and hit the slopes. Please note that spring conditions are in full effect. There are no beginner trails currently open. Terrain conditions can and will change throughout the day, so remember to ski in control.&nbsp;</p><p>Grooming went to plan last night. Kansas, Cyclone, State Fair, Lollapalooza, Grand Ave, Rogue Angel, Roundabout, Excalibur, Northern Lights, and Firestar were all groomed and are ready for the weekend.</p><p>Our<a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/season-passes"> New England Pass Spring Sale</a> is still availble until April 30.
