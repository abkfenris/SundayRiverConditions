Morning Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: November 17, 2023 </strong></em><strong>| 1:09PM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>It has been another great day of skiing and we are pumped as we head into the first full weekend of the season. This afternoon was a repeat of yesterday; fun riding and great snow on Lollapalooza and Rogue Angel. This has been a great start to the season, and we are grateful to share some of the best early-season skiing on man-made terrain we've ever experienced.&nbsp;</p><p>Tonight, the groomers will be out on Lollapalooza, Grand Ave, and Boots On Boots Off. They will be working hard to make the best out of what Mother Nature will be serving up tomorrow.&nbsp;</p><p>Daily lift tickets are now accepted. If you need ticket assistance, we have a Guest Service station located in the bottom terminal of the Jordan 8. All Ikon Pass holders who need assistance must visit the Welcome Center in the South Ridge Base Lodge.</p><p><strong>Please note, that there will be no beginner terrain available</strong> at the start of the season, and early-season, variable terrain will be present on all trails. Lastly, don't forget to check out our <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/early-season" title="Early Season Guide | Sunday River, Maine">Early Season Guide</a>.</p><p>A hike-park is set up in the Jordan Basin, with 4 features and a variety of rails and boxes.</p><p><span>Locke Mountain will serve as the resort's dedicated early-season training venue for our partners Gould Academy and Bates College, as well as pre-booked ski teams only. All public access to snow surfaces will be through the Jordan Bowl.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Please note that as crews work to expand the resort, all uphill travel is prohibited.
