<h4><strong>February 10, 2023 | 7:35 AM</strong></h4><h4><strong style="font-size: 2em;">Morning Report</strong></h4><p>After reviewing multiple forecasts yesterday, it was hard telling not knowing exactly what was going to happen last night. We started the late afternoon with some heavy snowfall continuing into the night. Temps began to rise as the night went on, and the snow started to get wetter and eventually turned to a cold rain. This morning, a decent layer of mashed potato snow covers the ground in the lower areas of our trails. Up top there is a breakable crust layer on top of the fresh snow. We recommend that beginner skiers and riders stay on lower parts of the mountain for the first part of the morning, as maneuvering in these conditions can be challenging until it is broken up by ski tracks and softened up by some time in the sun.</p><p>The weather will begin to ease up reasonably early this morning. The fog should begin to lift, and the sun will start to poke through the clouds. Temps will start our morning around the mid-30s and may go up to the mid-40s in some parts of the resort.</p><p>Although last night's weather didn't go our way, the snow will soften up quite quickly, and conditions will improve as the day continues. Let's just be thankful it's not a cold morning, and this moisture will be able to run down the mountain and not freeze into it.</p><p>We hope you can enjoy your Friday with us on the slopes and are excited for another great weekend ahead.</p><p>See you out there!<br />-Team Snow</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
