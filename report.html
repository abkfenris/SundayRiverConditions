Morning Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: February 17, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 6:35 AM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>Good morning and happy Saturday, Sunday River. Today, we have over 610 acres and 19 scheduled lifts for your skiing and riding pleasure. We're looking at temperatures in the mid to high teens at the summits and temps in the mid-twenties down in the base areas, cloudy skies, and a chance of flurries. Thank snow!</p><p>For groomed terrain, Bear Paw and Three Mile Trail rejoined the list. The grooming team also took care of all the new snow on Lower Downdraft, Grand Rapids, Broadway, Lollapalooza, Tourist Trap, and Lower American Express. They also laid stripes on all of Merrill Hill, as well, as part of the weekend lineup of groomed terrain. Those classic cruisers will be prime this morning with corduroy out of yesterday's powder, so check out trails like Right Stuff or Obsession for some first tracks carving. We will have active snowmaking on White Heat, Upper and Lower Vortex, Upper Downdraft, and the upper section of American Express today, but all of those snow guns should come offline sometime this morning.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/presidents-week" title="Presidents' Week | Sunday River, Maine">Presidents' Week</a> is here, and we have a whole host of events.
