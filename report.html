We've got great conditions on the docket again tomorrow. The snowmaking team will fire back up on Shockwave and Rocking Chair later this evening, and the snowcats are gearing up for a stripey night on all eight peaks. Plus, with nearly a foot of snow in the last five days, you can explore natural terrain too. Lifts open at 9AM tomorrow; who's ready for first chair?&nbsp;</span></p><p>Already dreaming of the next weekend getaway?

This includes full-day, half-day, beginner, Threedom additional days, and Passholder Friend tickets. We only expect these limits to affect peak dates, but encourage everyone to buy early to ensure access on the dates you want. Season passes, Ikon passes, and lift ticket packs remain direct-to-lift with no restrictions or reservations.</p><p>Fast and contactless lift ticket pickup is available at our PUBs (Pick Up Boxes) at base lodges and hotels. Just scan the barcode at the bottom of your confirmation email and your RFID cards will print with your lift tickets or ticket packs loaded. For best results turn off dark mode on your phone if you use it and avoid email apps that use dark backgrounds.</p><p>Before each trip to the slopes, make sure you visit our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/covid">COVID Winter Guide</a>&nbsp;to make a plan for your visit and stay on top of any potential changes.&nbsp;</p><p>Carve on,</p><p>- Team Snow</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
