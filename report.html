<h4><strong>February 19, 2023 | 6:30 AM</strong></h4><h4><strong style="font-size: 2em;">Morning Report</strong></h4><p>Good morning skiers and riders, and happy Sunday. As we kick off another week on the mountain, the team is preparing our slopes for your arrival. Snowmakers got outside after the last chair to turn on a few snow guns for the night. Their work will not go unnoticed today as the new layer of snow will surely soften up those trails. Our team treated the rest of the mountain to a fresh grooming. They took the trails over the night and early this morning to smooth out the rough spots and lay down new corduroy for the day ahead.</p><p>Weather will stay fairly cloudy for the day, with light winds and temps going up to the mid-30s. It should be reasonably comfortable skiing and riding out there today, and our snow conditions will begin to soften up as temps increase. All woods and ungroomed trails will remain closed for the most part until we see warmer temps or, even better, a fresh layer of snow.</p><p>Remember to check out everything we have happening this week for Presidents' Week. From Twilight Skiing all week long to bands, fire works, and live entertainment, there is always something going on during the holidays here at Sunday River.</p><p>We are seeing some good signs of snowfall at some point later next week, which is a great reason to take advantage of our<a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/resort-lodging"> one-night stays</a> now available for Presidents' Week. All properties, all week, grab yours before they're gone!&nbsp;</p><p><span style="color: #0e101a;">We'll see you out there!</span><o:p></o:p></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true"><span style="color: #0e101a;">-Team Snow</span><o:p></o:p></span></p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
