<h4><strong>February 12, 2023 | 6:30 AM</strong></h4><h4><strong style="font-size: 2em;">Morning Report</strong></h4><p>Good morning and happy Super Bowl Sunday. We hope you can make it to the mountain today before the big game for another fabulous day of skiing and riding. We will have all 19 lifts running today, allowing you to access all eight peaks of beautiful, freshly groomed terrain. <br />The weatherman has been forecasting partly cloudy skies today with low winds and temps ranging in the 30s. This will keep our trails firm and fast for the day unless the sun can poke through the clouds and help soften things up a bit.<br />If you are on the mountain today and looking to treat yourself, join<a href="https://bissellbrothers.com/event/apres-ski-at-the-foggy-goggle-2023-02-12/?_ga=2.109516741.1338160839.1675858495-1539782268.1669986993&amp;_gac=1.242443574.1674829901.EAIaIQobChMIxdG5xvvn_AIVMMmUCR14ewPeEAAYASABEgKXzfD_BwE"> Bissel Brothers</a> at the Foggy Goggle to celebrate the <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/bissell-first-chair-last-call-release">release</a> of their newest brew.</p><p>Take some turns before watching some touchdowns!<br />-Team Snow</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
