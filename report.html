<h4><strong>January 29, 2023 | 6:25 AM</strong></h4><h4><strong style="font-size: 2em;">Morning Report</strong></h4><p>Good morning shredders; it's going to be a fantastic day on the slopes here at Sunday River today. Our team was on the mountain overnight, grooming all the usual terrain and getting it smoothed out for another day of skiing and riding on our eight peaks. Terrain yesterday was firm enough to hold its shape and avoid getting skied up into moguls but was soft underfoot, gripping edges nicely as you carved down the slopes.</p><p>Snowmakers are actively making snow on mostly closed trails such as Bear Paw, Cut Off, Rocking Chair, Over Easy, Prism, Express lane, Broadway, and Quantum Leap. These snow guns will remain on into the day until we lose the necessary temps to create a quality product.</p><p>The weather today will be mostly cloudy, with temperatures ranging from the low-20s to mid-30s at the base. There may even be a few light snow flurries in the middle of the day and afternoon.&nbsp; We hope you find some time to make your way up to Sunday River soon as our open terrain keeps growing and the season continues.</p><p>&nbsp;See you out there!<br />-Team Snow</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
