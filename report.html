<h4><strong>April 22, 2023 | 6:45 AM</strong><strong></strong></h4><h4><strong style="font-size: 2em;">Morning Report</strong></h4><p>The sun is shining here in Western Maine, and we're getting ready for our season send-off out in the Jordan Bowl. With the move out to Jordan for our closing weekend, there is a lot to go through, so let's get into it.</p><p>First and foremost, the Jordan 8 will spin from 8AM-4PM. Skiing will be on groomed terrain on Lollapalooza, Rogue Angel, and Excalibur, and ungroomed terrain on Lost Princess. There will be no beginner terrain available this weekend. In addition, we will have no lessons or rentals either.</p><p>Limited skier services will be available out of the Jordan Hotel. The Welcome Center in South Ridge will be open Saturday and Sunday for further assistance on lift tickets or other purchases. We recommend stopping in South Ridge before going to Jordan if there are any lingering questions about your ticket or pass.</p><p>We will be accessing the lift through our RFID gates, which means that you must have your pass on you, or a lift ticket loaded onto your RFID Go Card. For Sunday, lift tickets are 0$, <a href="https://shop.sundayriver.com/s/lift-tickets/c/lift-tickets-1" title="Online Store | Sunday River">but still must be loaded onto a Go Card through the online store</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Parking will be based out of the Lower Jordan Parking Lot. This lot can be found on the left-hand side of the road when approaching the hotel. When you have your gear all on, you can access Lollapalooza at the southwest end of the parking lot, closest to the trail and the hotel. Walking will be required to get to the snow surface, but it's not far, we promise.&nbsp;</p><p>Food service will be available at the Sliders deck, with tasty options to fuel you up throughout the day.&nbsp;</p><p>It's shaping up to be a great weekend with tons of snow left to play on. We can't wait to see you out there!</p><p>-Team Snow</p><p></p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
