<h4><strong>January 5, 2023 | 7:35 AM</strong></h4><h2><strong>Morning Update</strong><span></span></h2><p>Good morning fellow mountain rippers. Mother nature is throwing more curve balls than Roger Clemens, but nothing can stop our mountain ops team from providing a skiable product. They have been on the hill since late last night, making snow and grooming terrain. Snowmaking will continue today blasting areas of Jordan and Aurora with fresh snow. Early this morning groomers scattered across the resort to groom those perfect corduroy stripes back onto the trails. White Heat quad will be closed, as well as trails on White Cap, such as Upper Tempest, Snowbound, and Obsession.</p><p>Clouds are sticking around today, making it colder than the last few days. Today's temps will allow the snowmaking team to continue doing their thing throughout the day. It also looks like possible snow showers are in the forecast for tonight, so let's keep that snow dance going and hope for the best.
