<h4><strong>March 9, 2023 | 2:50 PM</strong><strong></strong></h4><h4><strong style="font-size: 2em;">Afternoon Report</strong></h4><p><span style="font-size: 9pt;">The clouds stuck around today, making it a little chillier than forecasted. Conditions, however, were soft and smooth. Trails held their smooth shape but allowed edges to dig in with ease.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 9pt;">Groomers will hit the trails again tonight to redraw those beautiful Sunday river stripes back onto the surface. The weather is looking mild once again, with temps ranging in the 30s, partly cloudy skies, and gentle winds all day. It will be a fantastic weekend of skiing and riding ahead as temps will remain mild and the snow soft. Why not plan a last-minute trip to western Main this weekend to enjoy the nice weather and smooth groomed terrain? </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true" style="font-size: 9pt;"><a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/season-passes" title="Season Passes">2023-24 New England Passes are </a><a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/season-passes" title="Season Passes">now on sale</a>.
