Temperatures are currently in the single digits, warming up to low to mid-twenties throughout the day. Start the morning with a buff, and work on your goggle tan by this afternoon.&nbsp;</p><p>Our grooming team returned to their regularly scheduled programming last night, and we have 80 groomed trails, ready for your skiing and riding enjoyment. Start the day on Right Stuff for some classic carving, or check out Excalibur for a more relaxed ride. Our snowmaking team also returned to the hill yesterday afternoon, and there's currently active snowmaking on Broadway, Grand Ave, American Express, Boots Off, and Lollapalooza. Snowmaking should come offline around 9AM, but there will be ungroomed snow on those trails. Whoville is back open today after a feature reset, and Lower T72 will be closed today for its own reset.&nbsp;</p><p>Tonight, ski under the lights for some twilight skiing, or head into the Foggy Goggle to listen to James Rice from 3-6PM.
