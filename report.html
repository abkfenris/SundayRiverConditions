<h5>January 27, 2022</h5><p>Another beautiful bluebird day here at Sunday River. Though the temps are low, the stoke is certainly high today! Snow is skiing well and we're itching for more, which is why we're so pumped for this weekend's incoming storm. Today is still a bit of a brisk one, so please make sure you're properly layered up. Don't let the cold be a deterrent, though - this is what winter in Maine is all about. Embrace those temps and show the snow who's boss. Tonight our groomers will hit over 80 trails to set up that perfect corduroy for all your carving needs. We have over 100 trails open and don't plan on stopping! First chair is at 9AM tomorrow. TGTF! (Thank God Tomorrow's Friday)!</p><p>Please note that ski-in access to the Jordan Hotel requires the navigation of intermediate trails to reach Jordan Bowl.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Around the Resort</strong><o:p></o:p><a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/wicked-air-and-apres"></a></p><p><a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/senior-week" target="_blank" title="event details" rel="noopener">Senior Week</a> is here, from January 24 to 28!
