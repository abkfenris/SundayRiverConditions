<h6>December 6, 2021</h6><p><span>Today's soft snow made for fun turns, but cold temperatures are making a comeback by tomorrow. Our snowmakers are planning to fire up overnight, while our grooming team will wait to drop their tillers until the snow has firmed up. These conditions</span><span>&nbsp;may impact our ability to open ungroomed terrain tomorrow, but</span><span>&nbsp;we'll keep an eye on the weather and our Mountain Operations team will be at-the-ready to groom and make snow when the chilly air returns.</span><span></span><span>&nbsp;You can expect the Locke Mountain Triple, South Ridge Express, Spruce Peak Triple, and the Barker Mountain Express at 9AM tomorrow, and a delayed opening on the Chondola.</span></p><p>All lift tickets need to be <a href="https://shop.sundayriver.com/" strong="" title="online store">purchased online in advance</a>. Have your RFID from last year? You can head straight to the lift! Skier services are available in both the Barker and South Ridge Lodges, as well as shuttle service between these lodges and the hotels while the lifts spin. We are now accepting cashless forms of payment only.
