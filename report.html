<p><strong>December 2, 2022 | 1:35PM</strong></p><p>If you're planning on arriving today for the weekend, try to get a few last-minute runs in this afternoon. The sun is sticking around, the wind is calm, and there are plenty of groomed trails to choose from. Overnight the snowmaking team will work their magic again, followed by a solid groom to maintain existing trails and prepare for the opening of new terrain.&nbsp; Beginner terrain will be available tomorrow out of South Ridge, with all efforts set on opening new terrain as soon as possible.&nbsp; Please be aware of varying conditions and others around you as our season begins to pick up.</p><p>Can't wait to see you up there!</p><p>-Team Snow</p><p></p><p></p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
