Afternoon Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: March 27, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 2:02 PM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>Warm temps, soft turns, and 882 acres meant today was a great day. We're still skiing the powder from this past weekend, but it definitely feels more like spring today. Couldn't make it out today? No worries, because another great day is in store for us tomorrow.&nbsp;</p><p>Our grooming team will be laying stripes on 79 trails tonight, and they'll be pulling out the winch cat for Obsession. Excalibur and Airglow will not be groomed tonight. White Heat will be closed tomorrow, but it's for a good reason: the Bust 'N' Burn build will start tonight. White Heat will remain closed for the rest of this week as our team builds the course.
