<h5>January 26, 2022</h5><p>Happy hump day, folks. Today is shaping up to be a beautiful day here at Sunday River. Temps have started on the cool side this morning, but with sunshine on tap throughout the day, an extra layer should keep you nice and comfortable. Need some guidance on what to wear? Check out our guide on <a href="https://blog.sundayriver.com/layering-up-a-guide-to-thriving-on-east-coast-ski-days/" title="Layering Up | The First Chair">Layering Up</a> so you can spend the most time on the slopes. Yesterday's snow has been groomed into 79 trails across all eight peaks, resulting in the kind of immaculate corduroy typically reserved for that once-in-a-lifetime thrift shop find. All eyes are on this weekend, with the potential for a powerful nor'easter to bring more snow our way, so keep those snow dances going.</p><p>Please note that ski-in access to the Jordan Hotel requires the navigation of intermediate trails to reach Jordan Bowl.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Around the Resort</strong><o:p></o:p><a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/wicked-air-and-apres"></a></p><p><a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/senior-week" target="_blank" title="event details" rel="noopener">Senior Week</a> is here, from January 24 to 28!
