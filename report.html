<h4><strong>January 23, 2023 | 7:23 AM</strong></h4><h2><strong>Morning Report</strong><span></span></h2><p>A happy Monday to all our skiers and riders, and we can say that seriously since we had a fluffly 5" fall overnight! Today is shaping up to be a fantastic day. Snowmaking operations were happening all over the mountain last night and grooming went out and hit their usual trails. Some groomed trails may have their corduroy hidden under a few inches of freshies,&nbsp; but rest assured that all regularly groomed terrain has been tackled by our team.</p><p>It's still snowing pretty darn hard up here, and we expect the snow to continue throughout the morning. Temps look to be in the mid 20s for most of the day. Be advised that if we get favorable snowmaking temps, that snowmaking could come online on some of our green terrain. All in all, a really fantastic start to the week.</p><p>Today we're also kicking off the beginning of <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/senior-week">Senior Week</a>, where senior skiers and riders can take advantage of discounts, deals, and activities throughout the week.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;See you out there!<br />-Team Snow</p><p>&nbsp;</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
