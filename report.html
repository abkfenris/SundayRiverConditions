Please check lift status for live updates.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Enjoy your afternoon on the slopes with some peeks of sunshine before the snow rolls in late tonight. It looks like we could get a nice refresh on the slopes tomorrow with a couple of inches of snow, lining us up for another stellar weekend at the mountain. Our groomers will hit the slopes tonight on their normal 80+ trail route, but will be adding in some stripes on Quantum Leap and Polaris. Keep it up out there, start those snow dances, and come back tomorrow for first chair at 8AM.&nbsp;</p><p>Twilight skiing will continue tonight through Saturday for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/presidents-week">Presidents&rsquo; Week</a> with access to the Chondola and South Ridge Express until 6:30PM. As you plan your trip,&nbsp;keep in mind lift tickets are limited and days are close to selling out, so plan ahead if you want to hit the slopes this week.
