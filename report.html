<h4><strong>March 5, 2023 | 1:50 PM</strong><strong></strong></h4><h4><strong style="font-size: 2em;">Afternoon Report</strong></h4><p>It's safe to say that this has been the best week of the season, or at least the best week of the season so far. The off-and-on between powder and bluebird skies is always amazing whenever we can get it, and this week has truly had plenty.&nbsp;</p><p>Thanks to 3 feet of snow over the past week, our snowmakers will be taking some time off. They'll still be ready to go whenever the need arises, but with this base in place, we're feeling great. Grooming will be back on the mountain this evening, with intentions to resurface their regular list of trails.</p><p>High winds are expected to move into the area throughout the night and are expected to peak tomorrow morning. Please be aware that there is a good chance that lift operations will be affected.</p><p>Rest up, March is just getting started.</p><p>- Team Snow</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
