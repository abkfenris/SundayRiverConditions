<h4><strong>December 24, 2022 | 3:15 PM</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></h4><h2><strong>Afternoon Update</strong><span></span></h2><p>The common sentiment today was that conditions were "better than expected". When you're expectations are already the fastest recovery in New England, that speaks volumes to the quality of the skiing and riding that our Mountain Operations team was able to provide today. We are so thankful for all of their work. Looking ahead, the grooming team will be back at it tonight, putting another quality groom on the hill. Every night they're able to get on the snow, the better it gets. In addition to grooming, the snowmaking system has been pumping out snow all day, which will only contribute to the revitalization efforts.&nbsp;</p><p>It's looking like a beautiful Christmas morning tomorrow, so get your gifts open early and get to the hill for some incredible holiday fun.</p><p>We'll see you out there, and happy holidays from all of us here at Sunday River.</p><p>-Team Snow</p><p>&nbsp;</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
