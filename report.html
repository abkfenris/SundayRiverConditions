Morning Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: December 7, 2023 </strong></em><strong>| 7:52 AM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>We had a great day yesterday, and we&rsquo;ll have another great day today. We&rsquo;ll have some classic December weather today, with the colder temps of this morning warming up throughout the day. With partly cloudy skies and temperatures in the mid-twenties, you might even be able to start working on that goggle tan.</p><p>Our grooming team laid out some stripes for us last night on almost all of our terrain, but if you&rsquo;re seeking some ungroomed trails, head over to Lower Airglow, Borealis, and Aludra. The newest addition to our open terrain, Jim&rsquo;s Whim, is groomed and waiting for some turns. Our snowmaking team was hard at work last night, and there will be snowmaking on a few trails today, including Upper Sunday Punch. Keep an eye out for more terrain as we head into this weekend.</p><p>We&rsquo;re getting closer and closer to the grand opening of the Barker 6. Join us for celebrations staring at 8:45AM, with the first chair heading up at 9AM.
