<h4><strong>March 27, 2023 | 7:14 AM</strong><strong></strong></h4><h4><strong style="font-size: 2em;">Morning Report</strong></h4><p>If you were up early enough to see it, we were treated to a beautiful sunrise with cotton candy clouds and a soft pink light stretching across our 8 peaks. If you missed the show this morning, don't worry too much because today looks like a fantastic day. The grooming team got out and worked in the new snow we got yesterday, which will go a long way as we enter the thick of spring skiing.&nbsp; It didn't get too cold last night, so it shouldn't be too firm of a surface first thing, but it'll be sure to soften up as the morning progresses.&nbsp;</p><p>Weather looks awfully nice today with temps hovering around or just over the freezing mark and some fluffly clouds passing by throughout the day. We have a bit of a breeze this morning that is expected to die down as the day goes on. Currently no lifts are on hold, but we will of course update the Mountain Report if anything changes.</p><p>Please note that <strong>South Ridge quad will not open </strong>during the week but will reopen for the weekend.</p><p>It's going to be an amazing spring, so why not ski or ride <strong>for free</strong>?
