<h4><strong>April 5, 2023 | 7:45 AM</strong><strong></strong></h4><h4><strong style="font-size: 2em;">Morning Report</strong></h4><p>Good morning and welcome to Wednesday! We're waking up to a bit of a grey day here in Western Maine, but it does look like those clouds will hold onto whatever they may have for us until later this afternoon. Our grooming fleet took to the hill to resurface and lay those perfect stripes back down for today, including Obsession and Snowbound off of White Cap as well as the usual favorites. Natural terrain is expected to stay closed today as ski patrol continues to move across the mountain and assess the terrain. The snow surface will likely be fast and firm all day today as the temps hang out in the mid 20's, and low 30's. We are expecting some less than frozen, but maybe frozen, precipitation moving into the area around 2PM this afternoon. It's hard saying what Mother Nature will throw at us, but our fingers are always crossed for those snowy April surprises.&nbsp;</p><p>Please note that in order to access condos off of Ridge Run, you must<strong> take Dream Maker and then turn onto Ridge Run</strong>. We have operations on 3D cutting over the Ridge Run road and cannot have thru-traffic.&nbsp;</p><p>We have a lot still going on here at Sunday River; as we wind down the season be sure to check out our <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/spring.xml" title="Spring Operation Schedule">Spring operations schedule</a> and end-of-season<a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events"> events</a>. Next on the list are Pond-A-Palooza, the second spring concert series on Saturday, an Easter egg hunt, and Passholder lunch on Sunday.&nbsp;</p><p>See you out there!<br />-Team Snow</p><h4>A Note:</h4><p>Spring brings with it some of the best conditions of the year, but also the most variable condition. Please note that trail conditions may vary and change rapidly throughout the day.</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
