Keep your eye out for the many wildflowers and berries growing around the mountain, but beware, a family of black bears has been roaming the mountain enjoying the berries too. Please respect the wildlife that also call this mountain home and keep a safe distance between you and any animal.</p><p>Hankering for a sunny lunch at the summit? Ride the Chondola up to North Peak Top and follow the Summit Traverse/Trail E all the way to the White Cap summit! Enjoy lunch with a view of Mt. Washington before heading back down to the Chondola. If you&rsquo;re feeling adventurous, you can follow trail J down the side of infamous Shockwave before meandering through the forest to the Grand Summit Hotel. Please note, trail J is rated as extreme due to sections of steep rock that require scrambling and some athletic moves.</p><p>We have many new and exciting projects underway at Sunday River, including of the Jordan 8, which means we&rsquo;ve unfortunately had to close hiking access to Spruce, Aurora, Oz, and Jordan peaks. For your safety, please obey signage at all times and remain aware of your surroundings, especially when choosing to walk on roads. <strong>For the next two weeks, the Kids Adventure Trail/Trail H will be routed up Peak Easy and down Quantum Leap to Polaris.
