Afternoon Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: January 6, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 2:01 PM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>With temps in the mid-teens to low twenties, bluebird skies, and fresh corduroy, today was a great way to start the weekend. We opened up Paradigm this afternoon, bringing our count to 41 trails, 268 acres, and 10 lifts. It was a beautiful day to get out there and get after it.</p><p>Our snowmakers will be out the rest of this afternoon through tomorrow morning, with our snowmaking system operating at 100% capacity. Our snowguns on Broadway will come offline in time for Twilight skiing, which will be off of lift 2 tonight. Our grooming team will be out through the night as well, and tomorrow we can expect American Express, Overdraft, Borealis, and Paradigm to have some fresh stripes in addition to the usual terrain. It will be a cold one out there tomorrow as well, so be sure to layer up.</p><p>Tomorrow, check out <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/indie-demo-day" title="Indie Demo Day | Sunday River, Maine">Indie Demo Day</a>, where you'll have the chance to demo four of the top independent ski and snowboard brands: Parlor, Never Summer, Amalgam Skis, and Winterstick.
