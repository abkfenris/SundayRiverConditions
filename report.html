<h5>December 8, 2021</h5><p>Good afternoon Sunday River! The peaks sure do look good in white. Flakes have been falling steadily since this morning, so keep those snow dances going. Temps stayed favorable today, allowing our snowmakers to continue their expansion efforts resort wide. The grooming team will hit the slopes this evening to mix in today's fresh snow, meaning tomorrow is going to be full of carvable cord. Lifts open at 9AM tomorrow,&nbsp; so pack up the car and join us for some midweek turns.</p><p>All lift tickets need to be <a href="https://shop.sundayriver.com/" strong="" title="online store">purchased online in advance</a>. Have your RFID from last year? You can head straight to the lift! Skier services are available in both the Barker and South Ridge Lodges, as well as shuttle service between these lodges and the hotels while the lifts spin. We are now accepting cashless forms of payment only. Please be sure to have a gift card, resort charge, credit card, or debit card available for on-site purchases.</p><p><strong>Around the Resort</strong></p><p>Join us this weekend at the <a href="/events/feztival-of-trees" title="Feztival of Trees">Feztival of Trees</a> for some holiday cheer!
