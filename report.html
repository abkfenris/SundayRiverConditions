<p><strong>November 30, 2022 | 12:38 PM</strong></p><p>Well, folks, there really isn't a way to sugarcoat the storm system we're in. Warm weather has worked its way up the coast, and as many of you are aware, is currently over New England. While we're dodging the worst of it here in Western Maine, the precipitation currently falling is not our favorite kind, and looks like it will persist throughout the evening. That being said, recovering from undesirable weather is what we do, and we're ready to go once the window opens. Snowmakers are on standby and will be ready to begin re-surfacing efforts the second temps drop. Our grooming fleet will stay parked through the evening, with plans to venture out on the hill in the early hours of the morning. Confidence is high that with cooling temps and a little bit of time, they'll be able to work their magic once again and provide an incredible surface for our operations tomorrow. Stay tuned, and we'll be back with an early AM update tomorrow.</p><p>Today is the final chance to take advantage of our huge Cyber Week savings. Head over to our <a href="/cyber-monday" title="Cyber Monday">Cyber Monday</a> page and snag some deals on lift tickets and lodging.
