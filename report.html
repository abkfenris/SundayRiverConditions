<p><strong>December 1, 2022 | 3:22 PM</strong></p><p>What a way to welcome in December. Today brought a little bit of everything with it, including quite a little snow squall. It's nothing to write home about, but we're choosing to take it as a small apology from Mother Nature, one which we're happy to accept. Our dedicated snowmakers have been at it all day, keeping snowguns blasting during every cold snap. These efforts will continue throughout the night, with temps expected to drop into the low 20s and upper teens. The cats will be on the prowl tonight, laying down fresh stripes across all open terrain. Tomorrow is looking like a beautiful day with plenty of sunshine on tap.</p><p>We'll see you out there!</p><p>&nbsp;- Team Snow</p><p></p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
