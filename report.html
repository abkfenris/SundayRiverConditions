Afternoon Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: March 21, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 1:49 PM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>You know what they say about March: in like a lion, out like a lamb. This morning's winds are still holding strong, and we're definitely experiencing the "lion" part of March. These winds will continue throughout the night and into tomorrow morning before finally dying down sometime in the early afternoon tomorrow. By Saturday, lift operations should resume as normal- just in time for snow. The expected snow totals keep going up, so keep those fingers crossed, and think snow.&nbsp;</p><p>Our snowmaking team will be out on the hill again tonight, and we're expecting to make snow on Lazy River, Lower Risky Business, Tourist Trap, American Express, and Broadway. The snowguns on Excalibur might also come on later tomorrow morning. Our grooming team will try to lay corduroy on the same trails as last night, except for the trails with active snowmaking. Some trails at higher elevations may go ungroomed tonight. Check out the lift and trail status below for more information. Please note, we are expecting higher winds tomorrow morning which may impact lift operations. Uphill travel will also be closed tomorrow and will resume on Saturday.</p><p>This weekend, we have an <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/eddy-and-betty-dinner-mar-23" title="Edy &amp; Betty Dinner | Sunday River, Maine">Eddy &amp; Betty Dinner</a> on Saturday in the South Ridge Base Lodge.
