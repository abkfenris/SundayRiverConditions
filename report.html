Morning Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: January 7, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 8:03 AM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>8AM Update: 3" of snowfall and counting at South Ridge.</p><p>The snow has been falling, and it'll just keep coming. Keep those fingers crossed and think snow. Temps up top are currently in the single digits and mid-teens down at the base areas, so layer up before you head out.&nbsp; We'll be skiing and riding on 46 trails with 11 lifts today.&nbsp;</p><p>Our snowmaking team is nearly done resurfacing our open terrain, and they have mostly shifted to working on new terrain. Keep an eye out for new terrain by next weekend. Thank a snowmaker, because they have been working nonstop. Our grooming team was out all night as well, pushing the snowmaking piles and laying stripes on almost all of our 283 acres of open terrain. Double Dipper joins our open terrain with some fresh corduroy, and Escapade should be coming online in the next few days.&nbsp;</p><p>Only five more days left for <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/special-deals/dash-deals-sale" title="Dash Deals | Sunday River, Maine">Dash Deals</a>. They disappear at midnight on Thursday, January 11, so check them out before then for up to 20% off of lodging and up to 50% off of lift tickets.&nbsp;</p><p>Think Cold!</p><p>- Team Snow</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
