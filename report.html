Morning Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: March 21, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 8:21 AM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>8:20AM Update: All uphill routes are closed today.</p><p>Our grooming team is reporting about 6" of snow at various spots around the mountain, so three cheers for Mother Nature. With 6" today and more incoming this weekend, we would never know it's the first week of Spring. That being said, this storm is also bringing high winds our way. Please be aware that high winds are impacting lift operations, and currently the T-Bar and the South Ridge Express are spinning. Keep an eye on the lift and trail status below for the most up-to-date information. &nbsp;</p><p>Our grooming team was out and about all through the night, laying stripes on 73 trails. They hit the advanced terrain first, so there should be some fresh powder on top of that corduroy. South Ridge was finished up this morning, and this new snow was turned into some lovely stripes. In addition to the natural snow, our snowmaking team made our own snow on Broadway, Excalibur, Tourist Trap, Lazy River, American Express, and Risky Business. Temperatures should stay low, and we're expecting another snowmaking window tonight.&nbsp;</p><p>Later this month, come check out events like <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/bust-n-burn" title="Bust 'N' Burn | Sunday River, Maine">Bust 'N' Burn</a> and <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/spring-fest-weekend" title="Sping Fest Weekend | Sunday River, Maine">Spring Fest Weekend</a> with activities for everyone in the family.
