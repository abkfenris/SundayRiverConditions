<h4><strong>February 3, 2023 | 4:00 PM</strong></h4><h4><strong style="font-size: 2em;">Afternoon Update</strong></h4><p><span style="color: #0e101a;">Good afternoon everyone. Today was a true Maine Friday, but we were able to push through thanks to our incredible Mountain Ops team, and those who braved the weather were rewarded with some very good, albeit cold skiing. </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"><span style="color: #0e101a;"></span><o:p></o:p></span></p><p><span style="color: #0e101a;">Tomorrow, we are planning for an 8 AM opening following the same lift schedule as today. The Jordan 8, Chondola, South Ridge Express, Barker Mountain Express, Spruce Peak Triple, White Cap Quad, Little White Cap Quad, and the Sundance Surface Lifts will all provide access to the slopes. That being said, winds are expected to be cranking, and disruptions to this plan are expected. Information will be updated here as soon as available.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true"><span style="color: #0e101a;">As a reminder,&nbsp;</span><strong>all Uphill Access will be closed tomorrow.</strong>&nbsp;In addition,&nbsp;<strong>Night Skiing</strong>&nbsp;is canceled this weekend, as well as&nbsp;<strong>Apres Aglow</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Fireworks.&nbsp;</strong><o:p></o:p></span></p><p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto;"><span style="color: #0e101a;">See you in the lodge!<br />-Team Snow</span><span style="color: #0e101a;"></span></p><p></p><p></p><p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto;"><span style="color: #0e101a;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
