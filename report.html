The sun is also expected to dominate the sky today, so get working on those goggle tans.&nbsp;</p><p>Snowmaking had another excellent night last night and will continue their efforts as long as temps allow. While most of their efforts are on closed trails, keep an eye out for some fresh snowmaking on Broadway, as well as active snowmaking on portions of Lower Downdraft and American Express.</p><p>The grooming team had another great night and has been making great progress in the Jordan Bowl.
