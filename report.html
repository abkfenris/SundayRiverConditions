<h4><strong>April 15, 2023 | 6:35AM</strong><strong></strong></h4><h4><strong style="font-size: 2em;">Morning Report</strong></h4><p>Good morning and happy Saturday! We're gearing up for a wicked fun day here in Western Maine. The Chondola, Barker Express, Spruce Peak Triple, and White Cap Quad will spin today at 8AM with access to both groomed and natural terrain. Grab your wildest kit and some sunscreen and get ready to harvest some of spring's best corn. Local legend Donny Pelletier is here to help us send off the Barker Express on its final weekend of operations before construction for the new Barker 6 begins. Make your way to Monday Mourning to catch <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/donny-day" target="_blank" title="Donny Pelletiers Mogul Showdown" rel="noopener">Donny Pelletiers Mogul Showdown&nbsp;</a>from 10:30AM to 1PM then boogie down to the Barker parking lot for an afternoon of music and fun during the <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/the-great-tailgate" target="_blank" title="Great Tailgate " rel="noopener">Great Tailgate.</a>&nbsp;</p><p>While we are incredibly excited for all of the sunshine and celebrations this weekend, we do regrettably have to announce some changes to our <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/spring">Spring Operations schedule</a>.</p><p>The lift operations team, as well as representatives from Doppelmayr, have been battling a mechanical issue with the Jordan 8. Unfortunately, we will not be able to open the lift this weekend and have made the difficult decision to close Jordan until further notice while we continue to work on the problem.</p><p>Due to this change, we are adjusting our other lift operations to provide the most skiing we can. The Chondola will spin this weekend, with ski-in/ski-out from South Ridge access via Lower Lazy River and Easy Street. The Barker Express, Spruce Peak Triple, and White Cap quad will run today and tomorrow as well.</p><p>We were incredibly excited for the next two weekends of spring skiing in the Jordan Bowl, and this is definitely not how we wanted to end our season. We apologize for the inconvenience this causes and will continue to aim to make the best weekend possible with our available lifts. Our teams will continue to do everything they can to get the Jordan 8 running for our planned closing weekend. Any updates will be announced here, so keep an eye out for any further changes in our plan.</p><p>Have fun and ski safe!&nbsp;</p><p>-Team Snow</p><p></p><p><strong>Mountain Notes;&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Please note that no beginner terrain is available at this time and trail conditions may vary and change rapidly throughout the day.&nbsp;</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
