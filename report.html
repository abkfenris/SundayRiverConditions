<p><strong>December 7, 2022 | 2:25 PM</strong></p><p>Those brave enough to get out on the slopes today were most likely surprised by how good the skiing was. Visibility may have been low, and it wasn't our dryest day, but the turns were fun for those who grabbed. Thanks to the tireless efforts of mountain ops, our snowpack held up, allowing all trails to remain open. The grooming crew will work tonight into the morning to address trouble spots and get the mountain ready for tomorrow. Temps will not be in our favor for snow blowing tonight; however, warmer temps will also prevent the dreaded overnight freeze. If all goes as forecast, tomorrow should bring partially clear skies and comfortable temperatures, making it another great day to load the lift and get your snow legs going.&nbsp;</p><p>Let's start a snow dance!</p><p><br />-Team Snow</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
