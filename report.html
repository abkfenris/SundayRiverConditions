<h4><strong>December 30, 2022 | 6:35 AM</strong></h4><h2><strong>Morning Update</strong><span></span></h2><p>Trails are ready, and the lifts are warming up for the day. Our team is getting ready as we wait for another fantastic day to begin. The Snowcats were able to get onto the mountain early last night as snow guns were shut off all around the resort. They pushed piles of freshly made snow, cleaning up and grooming out Tempest and other areas of&nbsp; White Cap and North Peak. After reopening some trails that needed attention, the team took to the rest of the hill to redraw those perfect corduroy lines.</p><p>Ski patrol gave the ok to open Ridge Run from top to bottom, a great beginner run that wonders towards Merrill Hill and back to South Ridge.</p><p>Temps are definitely on the warm side for the end of December in western Maine, but that's not always a bad thing. Comfortable temps for everyone and softening snow throughout the day will make for fun spring-like trail conditions.</p><p>Only two more days left to take your final runs of 2022. We hope you can make it to celebrate the <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/new-years-eve">new year</a> in style, shredding the slopes and enjoying yourself here at Sunday River.</p><p>We will see you on the slopes<br />-Team Snow</p><p><b>UPDATED Uphill Policy</b><span>: Uphill travel is NOT</span><span>&nbsp;permitted until further notice.&nbsp;</span></p><p></p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
