We had a couple more trails open up throughout the day today, including Upper Airglow and Downdraft, bringing us to 261 acres of open terrain. With partially cloudy skies and a couple of snow showers, today was a great day for some midweek turns.&nbsp;</p><p>Our snowmaking team is planning on hitting the mountain hard tonight, and our snowmaking system will be operating at 100% capacity. They'll be working on some terrain that's currently open, as well as working on getting new terrain open for the weekend. There may be active snowmaking on open terrain tomorrow as temps stay cold. Our grooming team is planning on laying stripes on the same lineup of terrain for tomorrow morning, so get out there early for fresh corduroy.&nbsp;</p><p>This weekend, check out <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/indie-demo-day" title="Indie Demo Day | Sunday River, Maine">Indie Demo Day</a>, where you'll have the chance to demo four of the top independent ski and snowboard brands: Parlor, Never Summer, Amalgam Skis, and Winterstick.
