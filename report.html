Morning Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: March 20, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 7:35 AM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>Mother Nature might be sending some snow our way soon, but that doesn't mean we can't help her out in the meantime. We currently have active snowmaking across Barker, Spruce, South Ridge, and Jordan, and those snow guns blasting certainly make a lovely sight to see. Temps are currently in the low to mid-twenties, and they should warm up to the mid to high thirties by this afternoon. We're looking at some cloudy skies today, with possible snow flurries this afternoon - and more snow incoming in the next few days.&nbsp;</p><p>We currently have active snowmaking on Lazy River, American Express, Risky Business, Excalibur, Lollapalooza, and Rogue Angel. Lazy River and Risky Business will come offline this morning, while the other four will keep blowing snow through the day. Remember to check out the lift and trail status below for the most up-to-date information. Our grooming team took care of 75 trails last night. The trails with snowmaking got an early groom, but please note that they'll have ungroomed snowmaking on the surface. The bump run on Tempest was pushed out last night, as well. Please be aware that there is currently a groomer stopped on Cascades by the top of the White Cap Quad.&nbsp;</p><p>Later this month, come check out events like <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/bust-n-burn" title="Bust 'N' Burn | Sunday River, Maine">Bust 'N' Burn</a> and <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/spring-fest-weekend" title="Sping Fest Weekend | Sunday River, Maine">Spring Fest Weekend</a> with activities for everyone in the family.
