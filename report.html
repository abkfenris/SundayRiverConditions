Afternoon Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: January 17, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 1:26 PM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>Today we had a mix of cloudy and sunny skies, temperatures in the high teens to the low twenties, and 630 acres of skiable terrain. The snow last night combined with the efforts of our snowmakers allowed us to open 70 acres of terrain throughout the day, with more coming throughout the week.</p><p>Our snowmaking team will be concentrating their efforts on our eastern terrain tonight, and we're expecting snowguns to blow all throughout the night and into tomorrow. Our grooming team will provide us with corduroy on the same trails as last night, with the exceptions of Jibe and Tourist Trap.&nbsp;</p><p>We have a limited-time offer for lodging right now: book a single-night stay at the Jordan Hotel, this weekend only.
