Afternoon Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: November 18, 2023 </strong></em><strong>| 2:28 PM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>Oh, what a day. After some unsettled weather this morning, the clouds parted, making way for warm temps and soft turns as far as the eye can see. If you didn't have the opportunity to ski Rogue today, you're seriously missing out, but hey, there will be plenty more opportunities. While the past few days have been on the warm side,&nbsp;it's time to get back to our regularly scheduled snowmaking.</p><p>For this evening, the snowmakers will be flocking to the hill to take advantage of the cold temps. Primary efforts will focus on Jordan and parts of Oz, while we will also be working on expanding terrain offerings across Locke and Barker. As soon as the temps hit that magic number, all efforts will shift towards expansion. The grooming team will put fresh stripes on Lollapalooza, Boots On, Boots Off, and Grand Ave for another day on the slopes tomorrow.</p><p>For those needing ticket assistance, a Guest Service station is located in the bottom terminal of the Jordan 8. All Ikon Pass holders who need assistance must visit the Welcome Center in the South Ridge Base Lodge.</p><p>Please note that early-season, variable terrain will be present on all trails. Lastly, don't forget to check out our <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/early-season" title="Early Season Guide | Sunday River, Maine">Early Season Guide</a>.</p><p><span>Locke Mountain will continue to serve as the resort's dedicated early-season training venue for our partners Gould Academy and Bates College, as well as for pre-booked ski teams only. All public access to snow surfaces will be through the Jordan Bowl.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Please note that as crews work to expand the resort, all uphill travel is prohibited. The current <a href="/mountain-report#uphill_status">Uphill Route Status</a> can be found at the bottom of the Mountain Report. Also, all construction areas remain off-limits. Thank you in advance for allowing our crews the space to safely expand our terrain and complete the last steps of exciting new projects.</span></p><p>As always, keep an eye here for the latest info on our lift and trail status, as well as any other operational updates.</p><p>Think cold!</p><p>- Team Snow</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
