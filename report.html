<h4><strong>December 19, 2022 | 4:22 PM</strong></h4><h2><strong>Afternoon Update</strong></h2><p>It's been an absolutely gorgeous day of skiing and riding here in Western Maine. It's amazing what 2 feet of snow can do for conditions, isn't it? For this evening, snowmakers will continue completing connections across the resort for access west, and will also address some spots of need around North Peak. The cats will be on the prowl tonight, pressing perfect cord on 42 trails across 6 peaks. Whatever your flavor, there's certain to be something for you out on the hill tomorrow. We're rolling full steam into <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/christmas-vacation-weeks">Christmas Week</a> with enjoyment for the whole family. We'll see you tomorrow!&nbsp;</p><p>-Team Snow</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
