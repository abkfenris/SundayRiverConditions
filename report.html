<p><strong>November 23, 2022 | 7:22 AM</strong></p><p>Well, folks, the more runs you get in today, the more delicious food you can have tomorrow, and that's science. Get a head start on your calorie burning at 9AM when the Locke Mountain Triple and Barker Express begin spinning for the day. It's looking like another amazing day at the River, with fresh cord laid down on all open terrain last night. Slight warming throughout the day should soften things up <em>just</em> enough to create that true hero snow we're always so excited to ride. If you're joining us for the holidays, don't forget to check out <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/thanksgiving-dinner" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thanksgiving Dinner at Camp</a> and our opening weekend for <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/winter-activities/apres-aglow" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apres Aglow.</a></p><p>While our excellent Mountain Operations team has gotten most open terrain into mid-season condition already, pre-season conditions will continue to exist as we work on expanding our offerings. Please ski in control, and be aware of changing terrain. At this time, there is<strong> no beginner terrain</strong> available on the mountain. In addition to this,&nbsp;<strong>no uphill traffic is permitted at this time</strong>. Our team continues to work exceptionally hard to open additional acreage as quickly as possible.</p><p>It's not too late to secure your <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/season-passes" title="Season Passes | Sunday River">New England Pass</a> or <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/ticket-packs">Maine Ticket Pack</a>.
