<h4><strong>December 28, 2022 | 6:25 AM</strong></h4><h2><strong>Morning Report</strong><span></span></h2><p>The holiday week is marching right along. Can you believe that the new year kicks off in just 4 days? We are expecting some clouds throughout the day, but temperatures are forecasted to moderate making for some comfortable conditions all day. The snowmakers have been continuing their march to White Cap, with terrain expansion the #1 priority. This cold snap we've been experiencing has produced some excellent snowmaking temps, and they've been taking full advantage. The cats were also on the prowl, re-surfacing trails and pressing out that fresh corduroy.&nbsp;</p><p>Don't forget, we've got a ton of awesome events going on all week as part of our <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/christmas-vacation-weeks">holiday week celebrations</a>. With everything from live music to visits with Eddy and Betty, there's something for everyone.</p><p>We'll see you out there!</p><p>- Team Snow</p><p><b>UPDATED Uphill Policy</b><span>: Uphill travel is NOT</span><span>&nbsp;permitted until further notice.&nbsp;</span></p><p></p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
