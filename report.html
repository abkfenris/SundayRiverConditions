Three Mile Trail will remain ungroomed, and Rogue Angel will be closed today. Our snowmaking team was out on the ill last night as well, and they made snow on Vortex and Airglow. Please note that both of those trails will have active snowmaking this morning and will remain ungroomed.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/presidents-week" title="Presidents' Week | Sunday River, Maine">Presidents' Week</a> is creeping up on us, and we have events planned for the whole family.
