Tickets are sold out for Saturday, but still available for Friday and Sunday.</h6><p style="color: #696969; font-weight: 900; font-size: 12px;">THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 4</p><div><p>It's pure winter bliss out there right now. The groomers perfectly pressed the softest corduroy you can imagine across all eight peaks. But don't worry stash lovers, there are plenty of leftovers to be found thanks to the 14" of snow we picked up on Tuesday. Head to newly open glades, like Last Tango and Flyin' Monkey, because the goods are in the woods.&nbsp;</p><p>Lift tickets are sold out for Saturday, and filling up quickly for Friday and Sunday so make sure to buy yours soon. And don't forget that&nbsp;resort lodging guests can always purchase tickets at the front desks of their property, even when we're sold out. One-night stays are available this weekend at the Snow Cap Inn and Jordan Hotel.</p><p>When enjoying the snow out there, please keep in mind lift lines may appear longer than they actually are. Due to social distancing in and between lines, plus guests only riding with their traveling group, lines look longer than we're used to seeing, but move rather quickly.&nbsp;</p><p>Our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/booklodging?Checkin=2021-2-1&amp;Checkout=&amp;Adults=2&amp;Children=0&amp;Others=0#/room.xml">20% off midweek lodging sale</a>&nbsp;is still running and the&nbsp;<a title="presidents' week sale" href="/special-deals/presidents-week">Presidents' Weekend &amp; Week Sale</a>&nbsp;ends this Friday.</p><p><span>Please note we are&nbsp;</span><a title="Online Store" href="https://shop.sundayriver.com/s/lift-tickets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>requiring online lift ticket purchase</strong></a><span>&nbsp;and setting </span><strong>limits on the number of tickets</strong><span>&nbsp;sold for each day. This includes full-day, half-day, beginner, Threedom additional days, and Passholder Friend tickets. We only expect these limits to affect peak dates, but encourage everyone to buy early to ensure access on the dates you want. Season passes, Ikon passes, and lift ticket packs remain direct-to-lift with no restrictions or reservations.</span></p><p><span>Fast and contactless lift ticket pickup is available at our PUBs (Pick Up Boxes) at base lodges and hotels. Just scan the barcode at the bottom of your confirmation email and your RFID cards will print with your lift tickets or ticket packs loaded. For best results turn off dark mode on your phone if you use it and avoid email apps that use dark backgrounds.</span></p><p><span>Please remember to take a self-administered </span><a title="Health Screening" href="https://www.sundayriver.com/covid">Health Screening</a><span> and visit our&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/covid">COVID Winter Guide</a><span>&nbsp;before each trip to stay up-to-date on safety protocols and state guidelines.</span></p><p>See you out there!</p><p><span>Team Snow</span></p></div><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
