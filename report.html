</h6><p style="color: #696969; font-weight: 900; font-size: 12px;">TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 2</p><div><p>February, we like you already. Our groomers are reporting&nbsp; 6-8" of new snow this morning and it's going to be a free refill kind of day with snow falling all the way into tomorrow. If this storm plays out as we hope, we could see <strong>well over a foot of snow.</strong>&nbsp;Head to trails like Black Hole and go find the goods in the woods for some untouched terrain. South Ridge is getting groomed last and will be the best for beginners. Keep an eye out for more ropes dropping today, as we're hoping to get Last Tango added to the list. Get a few runs in before work, take a long lunch break, use that PTO, whatever you have to do to get to your happy place.&nbsp;</p><p>This is a prime opportunity to take advantage of our<a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/booklodging?Checkin=2021-2-1&amp;Checkout=&amp;Adults=2&amp;Children=0&amp;Others=0#/room.xml">&nbsp;20% off midweek lodging sale</a>&nbsp;to stay slopeside and hop on first chair and enjoy shredding all day, or to plan ahead and lock in a room with our <a href="/special-deals/presidents-week" title="presidents' week sale">Presidents' Weekend &amp; Week Sale</a> ending this Friday.</p><p>Lifts will open at 9AM today. Come to the mountain early and be ready to indulge in free refills all day. We hope you rested those legs, because this is going to be an awesome week. Please note that the cabins will remain off of the Chondola until this storm passes.</p><p><span>Please note we are&nbsp;</span><a title="Online Store" href="https://shop.sundayriver.com/s/lift-tickets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>requiring online lift ticket purchase</strong></a><span>&nbsp;and setting </span><strong>limits on the number of tickets</strong><span>&nbsp;sold for each day. This includes full-day, half-day, beginner, Threedom additional days, and Passholder Friend tickets. We only expect these limits to affect peak dates, but encourage everyone to buy early to ensure access on the dates you want. Season passes, Ikon passes, and lift ticket packs remain direct-to-lift with no restrictions or reservations.</span></p><p><span>Fast and contactless lift ticket pickup is available at our PUBs (Pick Up Boxes) at base lodges and hotels. Just scan the barcode at the bottom of your confirmation email and your RFID cards will print with your lift tickets or ticket packs loaded. For best results turn off dark mode on your phone if you use it and avoid email apps that use dark backgrounds.</span></p><p><span>Please remember to take a self-administered </span><a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/covid" title="Health Screening">Health Screening</a><span> and visit our&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/covid">COVID Winter Guide</a><span>&nbsp;before each trip to stay up-to-date on safety protocols and state guidelines.</span></p><p>Keep dancing!</p><p><span>Team Snow</span></p></div><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
