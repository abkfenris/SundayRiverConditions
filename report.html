This may affect lifts, so keep an eye on lift status for updates. The Barker Mountain Express is scheduled to spin with access to Sunday Punch, Lazy River, Lower Risky Business, Tourist Trap, Right Stuff, and Ecstasy. Our grooming team went out last night to smooth out all open terrain out for today's turns, so get those carving turns in early, with just two days left of the season.&nbsp;</span></p><p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline;"><span color="#333333" style="color: #333333;">We open at 9AM this morning, and then on Saturday, April 24, we'll open at 8AM for the <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/closing-day" target="_blank" title="event listing" rel="noopener">last day of the season</a>.
