<p><strong>November 29, 2022 | 3:02 PM</strong></p><p>Man-made freshies and perfect corduroy are two of our favorite things. Add in beautiful bluebird skies, and you've got yourself one heck of a day. Our snowmakers put up a valiant fight, keeping most of the mountain under the gun until early afternoon, and their efforts have truly paid off. They'll be back at it this evening as we continue to take advantage of every temperature dip possible. The groomers will also take to the hill, pressing in fresh surface for first chair tomorrow.</p><p>Time is running out to take advantage of our huge Cyber Week savings. Head over to our <a href="/cyber-monday" title="Cyber Monday">Cyber Monday</a> page and snag some deals on lift tickets and lodging. The sale disappears on Wednesday, so don't wait!</p><p>&nbsp;- Team Snow</p><p></p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
