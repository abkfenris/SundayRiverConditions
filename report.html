Morning Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: January 3, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 7:47 AM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>Drum roll please... Jordan Bowl reopens today! We're excited, and we hope you are too. Join us for skiing and riding on 255 acres with 9 lifts. Today's forecast has sunny skies, temps in the low thirties, and light wind. Sounds like a perfect day for some midweek turns.&nbsp;</p><p>Our snowmaking team has been working nonstop for the past few days, and they've been making snow all over the mountain. Our grooming team has been following suit, and they've been pushing out new snow and grooming new trails. Over on Jordan, Lollapalooza, Kansas, Rogue Angel, Boots On, and Boots Off will all be open and groomed. Access Jordan via Northern Lights to Firestar, which both have fresh stripes. Excalibur is scheduled for later in the day, and that will be ungroomed with whalebacks. The usual terrain on Barker and Spruce got a fresh groom, and Broadway on South Ridge got some new corduroy last night.</p><p>Temps are cold and holding, and we're marching towards expansion.</p><p>Think Cold!</p><p>- Team Snow</p><h4>Next Steps</h4><p>Following the opening of the Jordan Bowl, the Aurora Quad is planned to re-open Thursday, January 4 for the season.</p><p>The Chondola is currently loading cabins only.
