Afternoon Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: November 19, 2023 </strong></em><strong>| 12:30 PM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>It has been a great morning of skiing, and there is still time for plenty more runs. It had been nothing but blue skies and good turns, but the early afternoon presented some fun snow flurries for a short period of time.&nbsp;</p><p>Tonight, our snowmakers will be taking advantage of the cold temps, and will be making lots of snow across the resort, with our eyes forward on expanding terrain. Tomorrow, Rogue Angel will not be scheduled to open to allow for our Mountain Operations teams time to work their magic.</p><p>As a friendly reminder, and for the safety of all our guests, please take notice of changing trail conditions as the temperature and sun dips in the afternoon.&nbsp;</p><p>For those needing ticket assistance, a Guest Service station is located in the bottom terminal of the Jordan 8. All Ikon Pass holders who need assistance must visit the Welcome Center in the South Ridge Base Lodge. Additionally, from now until December 1, all rentals for Type 2 skiers and above, can be made, in person only, at the Sunday River Rental Shop. The equipment rental shop is located in the tunnel at the South Ridge base area.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Please note that early-season, variable terrain will be present on all trails. Lastly, don't forget to check out our <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/early-season" title="Early Season Guide | Sunday River, Maine">Early Season Guide</a>.</p><p><span>Locke Mountain will continue to serve as the resort's dedicated early-season training venue for our partners Gould Academy and Bates College, as well as for pre-booked ski teams only. All public access to snow surfaces will be through the Jordan Bowl.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Please note that as crews work to expand the resort, all uphill travel is prohibited. The current <a href="/mountain-report#uphill_status">Uphill Route Status</a> can be found at the bottom of the Mountain Report. Also, all construction areas remain off-limits. Thank you in advance for allowing our crews the space to safely expand our terrain and complete the last steps of exciting new projects.</span></p><p>As always, keep an eye here for the latest info on our lift and trail status, as well as any other operational updates.</p><p>Think cold!</p><p>- Team Snow</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
