After picking up 2-4" of fresh snow last night, the conditions today were as about as fun as it gets. Patrol dropped ropes left and right, including glades like Blind Ambition, Ruby Palace, and Hard Ball. Snowmakers will pick up the snow-game tonight on South Paw and Who-Ville, but will be off before lifts open at 9AM tomorrow. Groomers are sticking to their usual plan, but adding in Three Mile Trail into the mix.</p><p><span>This winter, your car is your base lodge.
