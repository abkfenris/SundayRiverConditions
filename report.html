Afternoon Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: February 15, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 1:21 PM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>Boy oh boy, it's a fast one out there. Hope you've got your carving skis on, because these conditions are perfect for laying into those edges. The sun is shining, temperatures warmed up some, and the breeze from this morning is dying down. What a way to wind down the day.</p><p>Tonight, our snowmaking team will continue resurfacing terrain. They're planning on making snow on trails such as Tourist Trap, Lollapalooza, and Wildifre, and we can expect some snow guns to stay online through tomorrow. Our trails with active snowmaking will get an early groom tonight, but they'll stay ungroomed tomorrow. Our grooming team will lay stripes on the usual midweek trails, and they'll also be taking care of the new snow on Lazy River, Road Runner, and the upper section of Tourist Trap.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/presidents-week" title="Presidents' Week | Sunday River, Maine">Presidents' Week </a>starts in a couple of days, and we have events planned for the whole family.
