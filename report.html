<h4><strong>April 6, 2023 |&nbsp; 7:34 AM</strong><strong></strong></h4><h4><strong style="font-size: 2em;">Morning Report</strong></h4><p>Well, it took some time, but Spring truly feels like it is moving into Western Maine. After a chilly day yesterday, we're looking at a high approaching 60 today, which will make for some excellent spring skiing.</p><p>Unsettled weather moved through the area yesterday afternoon and lasted through the night, which has left the mountain with some interesting conditions this morning. Trails will start with a slight glaze on them but will soften quickly due to the warm temps expected today. In addition to trail conditions, some lifts have experienced icing, which may delay their opening. Crews are on-site and are working diligently to get lifts spinning, but in case of any delays, keep an eye here for all of the latest updates.</p><p>It's shaping up to be an excellent run of weather here in Western Maine, and we've got a full slate of awesome Spring events coming at you this weekend.
