The team is heading out to cover Spruce and Barker with fresh snowmaking overnight, focusing on American Express, Ecstasy, Cascades, and Tourist Trap. The groomers are heading there first before moving to other peaks, so tomorrow the trail may appear ungroomed with fun manmade rollers to play in. Thirteen scheduled lifts will open at 9AM to access all eight peaks.&nbsp;</p><p><span>Looking ahead, the forecast for the rest of the week and into the weekend looks ideal for a ski day or two.
