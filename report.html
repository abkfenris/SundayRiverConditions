<strong>November 25, 2021</strong></p><p style="text-align: left;">Happy Thanksgiving from snowy Sunday River! The snowmakers continued to fire the guns on Monday Mourning, Tourist Trap, Risky Business, Lazy River, Outta Here, Aludra, Sirius, Lights Out, Easy Street, Broadway, and Cascades last night. Temperatures will hang in the high 30s today with partly sunny skies, so while you won't see snowmaking, we guarantee that you'll see plenty of happy folks carving turns down a groomed Right Stuff, Cascades, Ecstasy, Jungle Road, and Sunday Punch, with terrain park features on Upper Sunday Punch. Lifts are spinning from 8AM-3:45PM, and all terrain is considered advanced. Once you're done taking runs, be sure to head over to Camp's <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/thanksgiving-dinner" title="event listing">Thanksgiving Buffet</a> from 12-8PM at the Grand Summit Hotel.
