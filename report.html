</h6><p style="color: #696969; font-weight: 900; font-size: 12px;">MONDAY, JANUARY 11</p><p>Today was a gorgeous Monday with mild temps and a morning filled with blue sky, sunshine, and stripes across all eight peaks. Tonight groomers are going to head back out on the slopes and work their magic on the mountain. Along with their normal groom, they will also be putting stripes on Paradigm, Black Hole, and Grand Rapids. Snowmaking will continue tonight on trails like White Heat, 3D, Cowardly Lion, Lost Princess, Downdraft, Wildfire, and T72. The week ahead is looking much like today with great conditions and beautiful weather. Take some time out of your week to enjoy the mid-week bliss and hop on first chair tomorrow at 9AM.&nbsp; Please note that Barker Mountain Road will be closed and traffic detoured after the Brookside Condominiums on Tuesday morning as we fix the "Crater Of Doom" that has developed in the road.</p><p>Looking ahead, we're pushing to add even more terrain for the three-day Martin Luther King Jr. weekend, including trails like White Heat. Plus, we are currently offering <a href="/special-deals/mlk-lodging" title="MLK lodging sale">20% off resort lodging</a>&nbsp;for the long weekend with both of our slopeside hotels ski-in/ski-out. Please remember that lift ticket sales are limited, so don't forget to buy your<a href="https://shop.sundayriver.com/s/lift-tickets/"> tickets online in advance</a> this week as we head into a popular weekend on the slopes.&nbsp;</p><p>All three base areas lodges are open with full services at South Ridge including season pass pickup, shopping, and rentals. There are several additional&nbsp;<a style="font-style: inherit;" href="https://www.sundayriver.com/resort-dining"><strong>dining options</strong></a>&nbsp;around the resort, but please keep in mind that capacity is limited.</p><p><strong>Lift ticket pick up</strong>: Fast and contactless ticket pickup is available at our PUBs (Pick Up Boxes) throughout the resort. Just scan the barcode at the bottom of your confirmation email and your RFID cards will print with your lift tickets or ticket packs loaded. Don't forget to turn off dark mode on your phone if you use it.&nbsp;</p><p>As we continue to adjust resort operations to prioritize the safety of our guests, we are now&nbsp;<a title="Online Store" href="https://shop.sundayriver.com/s/lift-tickets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>requiring online lift ticket purchase</strong></a> or reloading and setting <strong>limits on the number of tickets sold</strong> for each day. This includes day, half-day, beginner, Threedom additional days, and Passholder Friend tickets. We only expect these limits to come into play on peak dates, but encourage everyone to buy early to ensure access on the dates you want. Season passes, Ikon passes, and lift ticket packs remain direct-to-lift with no restrictions or reservations.</p><p>Lastly, please remember to check our <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/covid">COVID Winter Guide</a> before each visit to make a plan for your day and stay on top of any potential changes. We&rsquo;re in this together and need your help.</p><p>See you tomorrow!</p><p>- Team Snow</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
