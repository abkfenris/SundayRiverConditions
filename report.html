<h5>January 7, 2022</h5><p>TGIF! We're heading into the weekend with 3" of fresh snow and the most open terrain in the East with over 400 acres to enjoy. The snowmakers have their eyes on the prize with guns blazing on White Heat, Rocking Chair, Paradigm, Vortex, Salvation, Wildfire, and South Paw tonight. Meanwhile the grooming team will be churning these fresh flakes into sweet, soft corduroy by the morning. We're open until 6:30PM on South Ridge and North Peak tonight for <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/winter-activities/night-skiing" target="_blank" title="activity" rel="noopener">twilight skiing</a>, and we have a fun weekend ahead with <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/winter-activities/apres-aglow" target="_blank" title="activity" rel="noopener">Apres Aglow</a>, <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/indie-demo-day" target="_blank" title="event" rel="noopener">Indie Demo Day</a>, and a <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/tap-takeover-maine-beer-co" target="_blank" title="event" rel="noopener">Tap Takeover with Maine Beer Co</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Both hotels are now ski-in/ski-out for your convenience.
