We are dancing with excitement in our ski boots, as temperatures are ideal for continued snowmaking overnight and into tomorrow. Please check the lift and trail status for the best ways to get in your runs as winds will impact lift operations before last chair. Winds are rolling out of town tonight so you can have a wonderful Wednesday morning. Catch 9AM first chair tomorrow for serene skiing on more than 600 acres of available terrain, spanning over 100 open trails.
