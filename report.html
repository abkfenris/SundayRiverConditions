<b>&nbsp;</b></p><p style="color: #696969; font-weight: 900; font-size: 12px;">TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 16</p><div><p>Alright, who was it? Someone forgot to snow dance last night and Mother Nature was not impressed. Instead of the huge storm we were hoping for she sent us 1-2&rdquo; of snow and wintery mix. Luckily for us, we have a second chance. Thursday into Friday we have storm number two coming in, and I think we are owed a good one. For today, you can enjoy slashing up soft snow and carving playful corduroy. The snowcats spent the night laying down stripes across all eight peaks but left trails like Black Hole, South Paw, and Quantum Leap ungroomed along with our other natural terrain. If you&rsquo;re just learning, start the day at South Ridge for the best beginner terrain. Groomers hit those trails last and left behind nice soft corduroy.</p><p>Lifts open at 8AM every day this week. Looking ahead we have sunshine the next couple of days and a snowstorm to end the week. Twilight skiing will continue tonight through Saturday for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/presidents-week">Presidents&rsquo; Week</a> with access to the Chondola and South Ridge Express until 6:30PM. As you plan your trip,&nbsp;keep in mind lift tickets are limited and days are close to selling out, so plan ahead if you want to hit the slopes this week.
