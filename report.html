LIFT TICKETS ARE SOLD OUT FOR SATURDAY, JANUARY 16 &amp; SUNDAY, JANUARY 17</h6><p style="color: #696969; font-weight: 900; font-size: 12px;">FRIDAY, JANUARY 15</p><p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline;"><span color="#333333" style="color: #333333;">Happy Friday! Today lifts open at 9AM to a world filled of corduroy and man-made bumps. The groomers took to the hill overnight, pressing out fresh lines all across the resort. Wildfire is set to open for the first time this season. White Heat, Downdraft, and Lost Princess remain ungroomed and filled with snowmaking piles to keep your legs working. Snowmakers came offline last night and are taking a much-deserved break as Mother Nature rolls through this weekend. The forecasts are calling for about a half of a foot of snow, that may or may not mix depending on elevation, so keep those snowdances going, wear your pajamas inside out, or only speak in pig latin. Whatever your superstition of choice may be, we appreciate it.&nbsp;</span></p><p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline;"><span color="#333333" style="color: #333333;">As we head into the long weekend, we are anticipating some winds at the tail end of this storm. In preparation, we removed the cabins off the Chondola to give us a better chance of avoiding a wind hold. We will be&nbsp;<strong>skiing and riding on all eight peaks</strong>&nbsp;this weekend and Oz Quad will be running. Plus, more fun to be had over&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/mlk-weekend">Martin Luther King Jr. Weekend</a>, including twilight skiing Friday and Saturday, an Indie Demo Day on Saturday, and fireworks with a fire dancer Saturday night.</span></p><p>If you're looking for a last-minute getaway, we still have resort lodging available this weekend. As an added bonus, <strong>all lodging guests are guaranteed lift ticket access, even when we are sold out like we are this weekend.</strong> Please note that we are experiencing high call volume in our call center and guest services, so we recommend using our&nbsp;<a href="/booklodging" target="_blank" title="Book Lodging " rel="noopener">online booking engine</a> for lodging reservations or quotes. Both of our resort hotels are ski-in/ski-out with access to beginner terrain and the Snow Cap in is a short walk or shuttle ride to the slopes.</p><p>There are plenty of food options around the resort for spreading out, but please remember that capacity is limited. Take a look at the <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/river-guide">River Guide</a> to discover locations, hours, online ordering, and how to make a reservation. For any needs such as season pass pickup, shopping, tuning, rentals, and SnowSports School, head to South Ridge Lodge.</p><p>For the safety of our team members and guests, we are&nbsp;<a title="Online Store" href="https://shop.sundayriver.com/s/lift-tickets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>requiring online lift ticket purchases</strong></a>&nbsp;and setting <strong>limits on the number of tickets sold</strong> for each day. This includes day, half-day, beginner, Threedom additional days, and Passholder Friend tickets. We only expect these limits to come into play on peak dates, but encourage everyone to buy early to ensure access on the dates you want. Season passes, Ikon passes, and lift ticket packs remain direct-to-lift with no restrictions or reservations.</p><p>Fast and contactless lift ticket pickup is available at our PUBs (Pick Up Boxes) throughout the resort. Just scan the barcode at the bottom of your confirmation email and your RFID cards will print with your lift tickets or ticket packs loaded. For best results turn off dark mode on your phone if you use it and avoid email apps that use dark backgrounds.</p><p>Before each trip to the slopes, make sure you visit our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/covid">COVID Winter Guide</a>&nbsp;to make a plan for your visit and stay on top of any potential changes.&nbsp;</p><p>Masks up!</p><p>- Team Snow</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
