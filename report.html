<h5>December 12, 2021</h5><p>Ever-changing New England weather is in full swing this morning, so pack your best parka to hit the slopes. Please keep an eye on the lift and trail status for updates throughout the day when considering this weekend&rsquo;s variable weather. Yesterday we opened seven new trails all with stripes to shred, and added another spinning lift to our list! A new hike park at the basin of Barker on Flow State is available for public use tomorrow, and you can see this park in action today at the USASA Rail Jam. Barker, South Ridge, Locke, the Chondola, Spruce, and White Cap Quad are all scheduled to spin from 8AM-3:45PM today.</p><p>Please note that our only beginner terrain is available within the South Ridge Express Quad at this time. With this in mind, skiing into the Grand Summit Hotel is currently accessible via blue terrain. Although the White Cap Lodge and Grand Summit Hotel are now ski-in/out, all skier services including shopping and guest service are temporarily concentrated to Barker and South Ridge Lodges. The Welcome Center at South Ridge Lodge will be closed briefly from Sunday, December 12 at 5PM until Monday, December 13 at 8AM while new flooring is installed for your convenience. During this time, guests will not have access to in-person consultation with our Guest Service team, but may contact them via email or phone. Look forward to carving fresh corduroy!</p><p><strong>Around the Resort</strong></p><p>Join us this weekend at the <a href="/events/feztival-of-trees" title="Feztival of Trees">Feztival of Trees</a> for some holiday cheer!
