<p><strong>February 4, 2022</strong></p><p>Today is one for the books, with <strong>9-12" of new snow on the slopes</strong>! We predict <strong>another 3-5" throughout the day</strong> as the flurries keep flying. Groomers put down stripes last night to make a beautiful foundation for all this snow. Excalibur, Right Stuff, Obsession, South Paw, and Rogue Angel are ungroomed for you to enjoy powder turns today. We have options for everyone, as groomers put down fresh corduroy on South Ridge right before first chair at 9AM. Our glades are beautiful this morning, so look forward to some great tree skiing. With this much snow comes terrain expansion, so check back here as we expand our long list of options.
