</p><p style="color: #696969; font-weight: 900; font-size: 12px;">THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 25</p><div><p>Mother Nature has been feeling feisty today with increasingly gusty winds. Many of our lifts will remain on wind hold, but lift mechanics will continue to perform wind checks until the end of the day. Because Jordan Bowl Express is on wind hold, there is no ski-in access to the Hotel. There are free shuttles that can take you from any of the lodges to our resort hotels or parking lots. Tomorrow the wind is supposed to mellow out so you can get out there and enjoy sunny skies and fast snow on the slopes. The groomers will spend the night on the mountain laying down stripes across all eight peaks. Hop on first chair at&nbsp;9AM to chase the morning corduroy tomorrow. The Chondola cabins will remain off due to the wind today. Remember you can take advantage of our <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/sunday-river-app">Sunday River App</a>&nbsp;for a quick and easy way to check trail and lift updates on your phone.&nbsp;</p><p>Want to hit the slopes in March?

This includes full-day, beginner, Threedom additional days, and Passholder Friend tickets. We only expect these limits to affect peak dates, but encourage everyone to buy early to ensure access on the dates you want. Season passes, Ikon passes, and lift ticket packs remain direct-to-lift with no restrictions or reservations.</span></p><p><span>Fast and contactless lift ticket pickup is available at our PUBs (Pick Up Boxes) at base lodges and hotels. Just scan the barcode at the bottom of your confirmation email and your RFID cards will print with your lift tickets or ticket packs loaded. For best results turn off dark mode on your phone if you use it and avoid email apps that use dark backgrounds.</span></p><p><span>Please remember to take a self-administered </span><a title="Health Screening" href="https://www.sundayriver.com/covid">Health Screening</a><span> and visit our&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/covid">COVID Winter Guide</a><span>&nbsp;before each trip to stay up-to-date on safety protocols and state guidelines.</span></p><p><span>See you tomorrow!</span></p><p><span>Team Snow</span></p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
