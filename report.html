<h4><strong>February 17, 2023 | 7:35 AM</strong></h4><h4><strong style="font-size: 2em;">Morning Report</strong></h4><p>Last night was just cold enough to firm up the soft, melted snow, but our mountain ops team had to wait until early this morning for ideal grooming conditions. They scattered to as much of the mountain as possible, breaking up and smoothing out the firm snow. We have been told conditions on the slopes vary from firm hard patches to soft play full mashed potatoes. This is all due to a mixture of factors, from the amount of moisture in the area to the amount of sun it receives throughout the day. As temps begin to rise, we hope to see the trails soften up as a whole and become more consistent today. In order to maintain snowpack not all usual trails were groomed last night. Please check the mountain report for all trail condistion updates.&nbsp;</p><p>Clouds are sticking around for the day, and temps will range in the low to mid-30s. Light winds will be present and may carry over some clouds and possible light precipitation. Let's hope the air can stay cold enough to keep this moisture somewhat snow-like and eventually turn it into snow as temps begin to drop after the day of skiing.</p><p>As we kick off Presidents week, check out everything we have going on throughout our resort. From Twilight Skiing all week long to Live bands and entertainment, there is always something going on during the holidays here at Sunday River. We are seeing some good signs of snowfall at some point later next week, which is a great reason to take advantage of our<a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/resort-lodging"> one-night stays</a> now available for Presidents' Week. All properties, all week, grab yours before they're gone!&nbsp;</p><p><span style="color: #0e101a;">We'll see you out there!</span><o:p></o:p></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true"><span style="color: #0e101a;">-Team Snow</span><o:p></o:p></span></p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
