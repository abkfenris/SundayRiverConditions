<p><strong>November 25, 2022 | 6:53 AM</strong></p><p>We hope you had a great Thanksgiving yesterday and are ready to burn off that third plate you ultimately decided to polish off. We've expanded to two bases and have the <strong>Chondola</strong> spinning out of South Ridge! South Ridge lodge, the <strong>cafeteria</strong>, and the <strong>Foggy Goggle</strong> will be open today. Trails accessible off the chondola will be American Express and lower Grand Rapids. Easy Street will be open as well so you can ski back to South Ridge. Be advised that active snowmaking will continue on this trail as temperatures permit.&nbsp;</p><p>At this time, there is no beginner terrain and variable conditions exist. Be safe, have fun, and burn off that turkey!</p><p><strong>Uphill traffic is now permitted.&nbsp;</strong>Please review our <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/policies-and-safety" title="Policies and Safety | Sunday River">Uphill Policy</a> before slapping on your skins.</p><p>It's not too late to secure your <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/season-passes" title="Season Passes | Sunday River">New England Pass</a> or <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/ticket-packs">Maine Ticket Pack</a>.
