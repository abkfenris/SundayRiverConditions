We&rsquo;re looking at over 165 acres of groomed terrain and seven lifts today, with beginner terrain open at South Ridge. All open lifts are scheduled for 8AM. South Ridge reopening yesterday means that our <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/lessons" title="SnowSports School | Sunday River, Maine">SnowSports School</a> reopened, so be sure to check them out for all of your lesson needs.&nbsp;</p><p>Outta Here is open to access South Ridge from Barker, and Lower Lazy River is open to access Barker from South Ridge. We will have crossing guards at these junctions to allow construction to continue. Please note that only the lower section of Lower Lazy River will be open. It will not be open from the top of the South Ridge Express</p><p>In case you missed it, we have dinner with <span><a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/winter-activities/eddy-and-betty-the-yetis">Eddy and Betty</a> </span>tonight, complete with a magic show.
