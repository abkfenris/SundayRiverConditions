Afternoon Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: February 13, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 7:34 AM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>Bundle up, folks. After the prolonged stretch of warm weather, cold temps have returned to Western Maine. It's looking to stay below freezing for the next 7-10 days, which means our snowmaking team will be back at it, and Mother Nature may even lend a helping hand.</p><p>For today, expect firm, edgeable trails on groomed surfaces. There will be stripes off every chair. No matter where you end up, you'll have some carving on the way down. Natural terrain will be skiing harder than normal today, so use caution when heading into the woods.&nbsp;</p><p>Our snowmakers are actively on the hill, working to resurface key spots and stockpile snow for the rest of the season. Upper Amex will have fresh snowmaking, and Cascades, Rogue Angel, and Lazy River are expected to have active snowmaking, at least throughout the morning.</p><p>Looking ahead, <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/presidents-week" title="Presidents' Week | Sunday River, Maine">Presidents' Week </a>is right around the corner, and we have events planned for the whole family.
