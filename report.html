Afternoon Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: April 27, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 1:05 PM</strong></h5><p>10/10 Spring Day. The corn is plentiful thanks to temps approaching 60's, and we're loving every second of it. Tomorrow is our final day for the season, and our annual 0$ Ski Day. Tickets for the day are free, but must still be "purchased" in the <a href="https://shop.sundayriver.com/s/lift-tickets/">online store to receive your RFID Go Card</a>.</p><p>The Jordan 8 will spin from 8AM-4PM tomorrow. Rogue Angel will be an ungroomed trail for the rest of the weekend. We're expecting to have the same trails for tomorrow, but check back in the morning for the latest information from Mountain Ops.</p><p>As we look ahead, Sping Sale rates on <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/season-passes">2024-25&nbsp; New England Passes </a>are still available until April 30. April 30 is also the last chance to renew your pass from last year, take advantage of 0$ down, 0% financing for qualified purchasers, and secure Youth Gold passes for <strong>just $599.</strong> Winter will be back in no time, so lock in your next season for less.</p><p>With May right around the corner, it's about time to celebrate the favorite mom in our lives. Why not take her out to brunch?
