<p><strong>March 30, 2022</strong></p><p>Good morning folks, and welcome to another beautiful Wednesday on the mountain. Today is shaping up to be an absolute stunner, with sunshine all day, and warmth making its way back to the Mahoosucs this afternoon. The grooming team put fresh cord down on 66 trails for your enjoyment. Carve it up for first chair at 9AM, and then hang around into the afternoon for soft turns. The remnants of yesterday's winds are still hanging around this morning, which could impact lift services to the higher peaks. We are expecting the breeze to diminish throughout the day, so keep an eye here for the most up-to-date lift and trail information.</p><p><a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/blog/jordan-8-construction-begins.xml" title="Construction Begins on the Jordan 8 Lift">Construction for the Jordan 8 has begun</a>!
