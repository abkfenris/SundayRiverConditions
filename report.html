<p><strong>February 1, 2022</strong></p><p>Take your Tuesday turns on 799 acres of terrain this afternoon. We have been adding to our growing list of open trails today, and since this morning we have dropped ropes on Downdraft and Ruby Palace. The sun is shining on the slopes today, making it a perfect time to carve into 81 corduroy trails. Groomers are putting down fresh stripes tonight across all 8 peaks, and Mother Nature is bringing in more snow as we ski into the weekend.
