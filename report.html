<h4><strong>January 4, 2023 | 1:08 PM&nbsp;</strong></h4><h2><strong>Afternoon Update</strong><span></span></h2><p>The weather moving in through tomorrow night isn't looking awesome, but hey, it could be a whole lot worse for Western Maine. Warm temps will persist throughout the evening, which means that our grooming team will be doing limited grooming to preserve as much of the snowpack as possible. We'll be back in the morning with a final call on what was and was not groomed. This also means our snowmakers will be getting a well-deserved rest. Don't worry though, once the cold air hits on the backside of this front, they'll be ready to get after it for the weekend.&nbsp;</p><p>Speaking of cold air, there are still forecasts suggesting anywhere from 2-5" of snowfall after this precipitation turns over. It will be over a long duration, so don't expect any face shots to come out of it, but at this point we'll take every flake Mother Nature has for us.</p><p>In other news,&nbsp;<strong>uphill access has now re-opened,</strong> but please check out our new <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/policies-and-safety">Uphill Policy</a> before taking to the slopes, as we've made some adjustments.&nbsp;</p><p>Keep the snow dances going!</p><p>&nbsp;-Team Snow</p><p></p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
