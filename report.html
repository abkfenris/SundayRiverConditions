Afternoon Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: March 5, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 2:05 PM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>There's no way around it folks, it's a warm one out there. While it's the last thing we ever want to be talking about, it's going to rain the next two nights, with warm temps in between. Thanks to the dedicated efforts of our snowmakers, we're in great shape on our trails and you can look forward to delightful soft snow, but there will be some changes to our grooming for the next two nights.&nbsp;</p><p>With this much moisture and warm temps in the snow, disrupting the snowpack with the groomers is doing more harm than good. In the interest of preserving our snowpack, we will be doing limited grooming for the next two nights. The current plan is to groom at least one run from the top of every peak, plus most green terrain. There may be some additional trails thrown in the mix, so check in in the morning for the most up-to-date information.&nbsp;</p><p>While this weather pattern is certainly not ideal, we are in great shape for excellent end-of-March and April skiing. Plus, the forecast sure looks like it might be changing in our favor, but more on that later.&nbsp;</p><p><span>As always, check out the <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events">events calendar</a> for the lineup of activities and performances throughout the rest of the month.
