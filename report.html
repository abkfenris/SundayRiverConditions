<p><strong>February 7, 2022</strong></p><p>No sign of the Monday blues on the slopes! Stunning conditions have us skiing every chance we get on 134 glades and trails. After a calm morning of carving, we are shredding snow stashes. Over the past week we have had fantastic snowfall totals close to 3 feet across all 8 peaks. We will keep you updated as a few more inches of flurries are forecasted to start tonight, and continue into tomorrow. An adventure awaits within almost 2,000 acres, including our <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/boundary-to-boundary">boundary-to-boundary skiing</a> options. With all of our open terrain, you can take turns among the trees, ski powdery trails, and carve fresh corduroy all day. Tonight groomers are putting stripes on nearly 90 trails for you to enjoy. Catch first chair flurries at 9AM tomorrow morning!</p><p><strong>Around the Resort</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/presidents-week.xml">Presidents' Week</a> is less than two weeks away!
