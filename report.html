<h4><strong>February 5, 2023 | 6:30</strong></h4><h4><strong style="font-size: 2em;">Morning Report</strong></h4><p>Good morning and happy Sunday, my fellow shredders. All is calm once again here at the resort. Winds have disappeared, and clouds are beginning to fade away as the sun rises over the mountain's horizon. Temps start the day at 0 degrees and will continue to warm up to around 20 degrees by mid-day. With little to no winds forecasted today, these temps won't seem nearly as cold as the past few days.</p><p>Our lift schedule is back to normal today, running all 19 lifts across our eight peaks. We have over 100 open trails across over 700 acres of terrain. Our team got out onto the hill early last night to soften up the firm snowpack and groom out that fresh corduroy for a fantastic day ahead of us.</p><p>Are you feeling like trying something new? Telemarkdown is hosting the <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/freeheelers-demo-tour">FreeHeeler's Demo Tour</a> today. Stop by their tent at White Cap Base area to sign up for today's clinics. As always, keep an eye on the snow report for updated trail conditions and statuses as ski patrol gets onto the hill this morning to inspect trails and look to open more terrain for the day.</p><p>See you out there!<br />-Team Snow</p><p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto;"><span style="color: #0e101a;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
