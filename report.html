<h4><strong>April 16, 2023 | 6:30 AM</strong><strong></strong></h4><h4><strong style="font-size: 2em;">Morning Report</strong></h4><p>It's a great day to ski, and it's a Sunday slated for celebration!&nbsp;Today is the <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/barker-express-final-send-off" target="_blank" title="Barker Express Final Send-Off" rel="noopener">Barker Express' final hurrah! </a>Stop by the merch tent in the Barker Basin this morning, we will be giving out commemorative coasters and koozies. At 4PM, please join us as we send the final chair of the Barker Express up the mountain.&nbsp;</p><p>The Chondola will spin today, with ski-in/ski-out from South Ridge access via Lower Lazy River. The Barker Express, Spruce Peak Triple, and White Cap quad will be open as well. Spring skiing is certainly here, so don't forget the sunscreen. The sun will join us throughout the day and temps will reach 60 by mid morning and continue to rise into the afternoon.&nbsp;</p><p>While we are incredibly excited for all of the sunshine and celebrations this weekend, we do regrettably have to announce some changes to our <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/spring">Spring Operations schedule</a>.</p><p>The lift operations team, as well as representatives from Doppelmayr, have been battling a mechanical issue with the Jordan 8. Unfortunately, we will not be able to open the lift this weekend and have made the difficult decision to close Jordan until further notice while we continue to work on the problem.</p><p>We were incredibly excited for the next two weekends of spring skiing in the Jordan Bowl, and this is definitely not how we wanted to end our season. We apologize for the inconvenience this causes and will continue to aim to make the best weekend possible with our available lifts. Our teams will continue to do everything they can to get the Jordan 8 running for our planned closing weekend. Any updates will be announced here, so keep an eye out for any further changes in our plan.</p><p>Have fun and ski safe!&nbsp;</p><p>-Team Snow</p><p><strong>Mountain Notes;&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Please note that no beginner terrain is available at this time and trail conditions may vary and change rapidly throughout the day.&nbsp;</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
