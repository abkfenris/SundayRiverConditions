There is plenty of fun to be had all across the mountain today, so continue to carve around and enjoy every bit of it. To top it all off, we're skiing and riding with some seasonable temperatures and some sunshine. Groomers will head out overnight to smooth things out for tomorrow's turns. Please note that we are anticipating high winds tomorrow that may affect lifts. Please check in on lift status in the morning for updates.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>If you get hungry while on the slopes today we have plenty of food options to enjoy. Order online, head to the South Ridge takeout window, or make a reservation at one of our <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/river-guide">resort dining locations</a>.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;Take advantage of the day and enjoy your meals outside on the decks and picnic areas.&nbsp;</span></span></p><p>Want to hit the slopes in March?

This includes full-day, beginner, Threedom additional days, and Passholder Friend tickets. We only expect these limits to affect peak dates, but encourage everyone to buy early to ensure access on the dates you want. Season passes, Ikon passes, and lift ticket packs remain direct-to-lift with no restrictions or reservations.</span></p><p><span>Fast and contactless lift ticket pickup is available at our PUBs (Pick Up Boxes) at base lodges and hotels. Just scan the barcode at the bottom of your confirmation email and your RFID cards will print with your lift tickets or ticket packs loaded. For best results turn off dark mode on your phone if you use it and avoid email apps that use dark backgrounds.</span></p><p><span>Please remember to take a self-administered </span><a title="Health Screening" href="https://www.sundayriver.com/covid">Health Screening</a><span> and visit our&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/covid">COVID Winter Guide</a><span>&nbsp;before each trip to stay up-to-date on safety protocols and state guidelines.</span></p><p><span>Masks up!</span></p><p><span>Team Snow</span></p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
