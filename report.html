<h4><strong>March 17, 2023 | 7:30 AM</strong><strong></strong></h4><h4><strong style="font-size: 2em;">Morning Report</strong></h4><p>Friday has finally arrived, and the weekend is within reach. Our mountain ops team got onto the hill to groom out the usual weekday trails and provide us with some excellent conditions for the day. Skiing will start firm, but trails will soften as the day begins to warm up. Woods and natural terrain are quite skied-off, but the snowpack is still thick, and plenty of coverage exists.</p><p>We are seeing mixed forecasts for today. Temps will be warm, and clouds will pass by throughout the day. However, some reports state slight precipitation in the area early this morning and later this afternoon. Let's hope temps remain cold enough up top, and the clouds pass by quickly today, as things could get interesting later on.</p><p>It will be another beautiful weekend in western Maine with warm temps in the forecast, sunny skies, and over 800 acres of skiable terrain to explore.
