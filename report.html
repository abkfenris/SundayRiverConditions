<h5>January 17, 2022</h5><p><span>As the storm heads out, leaving behind nearly a foot of fresh snow, we're appreciating our legs today. The endless refills kept us going all day long, especially as ropes dropped across the resort, granting us access to a dozen new trails, including Last Tango, Wizard's Gultch, and Enchanted Forest. Better rest up because tomorrow we get to enjoy all of those stashes under blue skies.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Lifts open at 9AM tomorrow with the most open terrain the in East on 100 trails. Groomers are heading out in full force to press out perfect corduroy. The forecast is calling for some wind, but it's too early to tell if it will impact lift status. Check back in the morning for more details.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Please note that ski-in access to the Jordan Hotel requires the navigation of intermediate trails to reach Jordan Bowl.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Around the Resort</strong><o:p></o:p></p><p>We've got some fun events coming up! <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/wicked-air-and-apres">Wicked Air &amp; Apr&egrave;s</a> is returning to Barker next Saturday, January 22.
