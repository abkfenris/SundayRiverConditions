We are experiencing some wind which is affecting lifts. Our team will continue to assess and open lifts as soon as Mother Nature allows, so continue to check lift status for updates.</p><p>Our snowmaking team has been out there doing what they do best, keeping us in full winter mode. As they continue to refresh trails and continue building up the base on Barker and Spruce, guns were on full blast overnight on trails like Right Stuff, Lower Sunday Punch, and Risky Business. Groomers went out overnight, pressing stripes across 60+ trails for today's turns.&nbsp;</p><p>If you are looking for a last-minute getaway we still have rooms available at the Grand Summit Hotel and the Snow Cap Inn this weekend. Availability is limited so please call <strong>800.543.2754</strong> to book. Remember, when you book lodging with us you are guaranteed a lift ticket even when we are sold out like we are for Saturday. Start packing the car, because the weekend is looking nice with sunshine, snowmaking, and endless stripes across all eight peaks.&nbsp;</p><p><span>The <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/season-passes" title="Season Passes">2021-22 New England Pass is back on sale</a>, granting access to Sunday River, Loon &amp; Sugarloaf all next year.
