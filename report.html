<h5>January 8, 2022</h5><p>Welcome to another weekend of skiing and riding on the most open terrain in the east. Our snowmakers have continued to take advantage of these perfect temps, with eyes set on new terrain coming soon. The grooming team worked their magic last night, taking the 3&rdquo; of fresh snow we received yesterday and turning it into perfectly pressed corduroy. Head on over to Aurora and be the first to claim your turns on Northern Lights, making its top-to-bottom season debut. There is some wind in the area which will be dwindling throughout the morning, so keep your eyes here for the most up-to-date lift statuses. <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/winter-activities/night-skiing" target="_blank" title="activity" rel="noopener">Twilight skiing</a> is open on North Ridge and South Peak until 6:30PM tonight, and be sure to check out awesome events like <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/winter-activities/apres-aglow" target="_blank" title="activity" rel="noopener">Apres Aglow</a>, <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/indie-demo-day" target="_blank" title="event" rel="noopener">Indie Demo Day</a>, and a <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/tap-takeover-maine-beer-co" target="_blank" title="event" rel="noopener">Tap Takeover with Maine Beer Co</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Both hotels are now ski-in/ski-out for your convenience.
