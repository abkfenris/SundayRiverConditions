<h4><strong>April 7, 2023 |&nbsp; 2:25 PM</strong><strong></strong></h4><h4><strong style="font-size: 2em;">Afternoon Report</strong></h4><p>Though the wind was whippin', we were able to keep most of the lifts spinning throughout the day. The snow on groomed trails was excellent; soft but not too piled up and still edgeable underneath. It also stayed a bit warmer than was predicted, so that was a nice little surprise.&nbsp;</p><p>Looking to the night shift, temps look favorable for grooming to get an earlier start to smooth out some of those bumps around the mountain. They're also looking to groom out Merrill Hill terrain for its final weekend.&nbsp;</p><p>And speaking of the weekend, this weekend is looking phenomenal, and we've got a full slate of awesome Spring events coming at you. Pond-A-Palooza and our final Spring Concert of the year are tomorrow. We've also got some Easter activities and the Passholder Appreciation lunch on tap for Sunday. For all of the events through the rest of the year, check out the <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events" target="_blank" title="Events | Sunday River" rel="noopener">full schedule</a> here.</p><p>As we wind down for the season be sure to check out our <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/spring.xml" title="Spring Operation Schedule">Spring operations schedule</a> for all of the info on what lifts are spinning and when.</p><p>See you out there!<br />-Team Snow</p><h4>Mountain Notes:</h4><p>If you're looking to get over to Jordan from South Ridge, ski on over to Spruce Peak Triple and take Sirius &gt; Aludra &gt; Cyclone &gt; State Fair. Kansas will bring you back from Jordan to South Ridge when you're ready to head back East.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Spring brings with it some of the best conditions of the year, but also the most variable condition. Please note that trail conditions may vary and change rapidly throughout the day.</p><p>Please note that in order to access condos off of Ridge Run, you must<strong> take Dream Maker and then turn onto Ridge Run</strong>.
