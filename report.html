</h6><p style="color: #696969; font-weight: 900; font-size: 12px;">TUESDAY, JANUARY 12</p><p>We kicked off Tuesday's turns with the debut of Paradigm and Black Hole and ropes just dropped on Downdraft. Keep it up out there with sunshine and beautiful conditions. Groomers will head out tonight on their normal routes, but will add 3D to their list. Snowmaking temps should come back tonight so that our team can continue to blast snow on Salvation, Cowardly Lion, Lost Princess, Rocking Chair, Wildfire, and Vortex. The week ahead is looking awesome, so take some time out of your week to enjoy the mid-week bliss and hop on first chair at 9AM tomorrow.&nbsp; Please note that Barker Mountain Road is closed and traffic detoured after the Brookside Condominiums this morning as we fix the "Crater Of Doom" that has developed in the road.</p><p>Looking ahead, we're pushing to add even more terrain for the three-day Martin Luther King Jr. weekend. Plus, we are currently offering <a href="/special-deals/mlk-lodging" title="MLK lodging sale">20% off resort lodging</a>&nbsp;for the long weekend with both of our slopeside hotels ski-in/ski-out. Please remember that lift ticket sales are limited, so don't forget to buy your<a href="https://shop.sundayriver.com/s/lift-tickets/"> tickets online in advance</a> this week as we head into a popular weekend on the slopes.&nbsp;</p><p>All three base areas lodges are open with full services at South Ridge including season pass pickup, shopping, and rentals. There are several additional&nbsp;<a style="font-style: inherit;" href="https://www.sundayriver.com/resort-dining"><strong>dining options</strong></a>&nbsp;around the resort, but please keep in mind that capacity is limited.</p><p><strong>Lift ticket pick up</strong>: Fast and contactless ticket pickup is available at our PUBs (Pick Up Boxes) throughout the resort. Just scan the barcode at the bottom of your confirmation email and your RFID cards will print with your lift tickets or ticket packs loaded. Don't forget to turn off dark mode on your phone if you use it.&nbsp;</p><p>As we continue to adjust resort operations to prioritize the safety of our guests, we are now&nbsp;<a title="Online Store" href="https://shop.sundayriver.com/s/lift-tickets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>requiring online lift ticket purchase</strong></a> or reloading and setting <strong>limits on the number of tickets sold</strong> for each day. This includes day, half-day, beginner, Threedom additional days, and Passholder Friend tickets. We only expect these limits to come into play on peak dates, but encourage everyone to buy early to ensure access on the dates you want. Season passes, Ikon passes, and lift ticket packs remain direct-to-lift with no restrictions or reservations.</p><p>Lastly, please remember to check our <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/covid">COVID Winter Guide</a> before each visit to make a plan for your day and stay on top of any potential changes. We&rsquo;re in this together and need your help.</p><p>See you tomorrow!</p><p>- Team Snow</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
