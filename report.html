<h4><strong>February 24, 2023 | 1:00 PM</strong></h4><h4><strong style="font-size: 2em;">Afternoon Report</strong></h4><p>The wind was not on our side today, putting most of our lifts on wind hold for this morning. Although this created pretty long lines around our resort, the skiing and riding were still excellent as all this new snow has softened up our surface nicely. Winds have begun to calm down, and lifts are starting to open up again for the afternoon. Keep an eye on the mountain report as we are constantly checking lifts for wind.&nbsp;</p><p>Snowguns will remain off for the night, and the rest of our team will get onto the hill shortly after the last chair tonight. They will groom in all this new snow on the usual trails, smoothing out moguls and skied-off areas. Tomorrow's forecast says cold and cloudy again, with temps in the 10s-20s and mild winds for the day.</p><p>If you haven't already, be sure to sign up for<a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/laser-tag"> laser tag</a> tonight at the Grand Summit hotel.
