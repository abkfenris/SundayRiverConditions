Morning Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: January 11, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 7:47 AM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>Today, we're looking at temps in the high twenties to low thirties and cloudy - but dry - skies. We have over 350 acres of terrain for your skiing and riding pleasure, with 11 open lifts. It should be firmer out there this morning, ideally softening up as temps warm up and the sun peaks out over the next few hours.&nbsp;</p><p>Our snowmaking team had a scheduled maintenance night last night, although we expect guns to fire back up tonight as we head into the weekend. Our grooming team had a busy night as well, and they added Ridge Run, Three Mile Trail, and Jim's Whim to our list of groomed terrain. We have plenty of ungroomed terrain for those seeking an extra challenge, so head over to trails like Wizard's Gulch and Lower Caramba if the natural terrain is calling you. For even more adventure, check out the whalebacks on Tempest.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/special-deals/dash-deals-sale" title="Dash Deals | Sunday River, Maine">Dash Deals</a> are already on their way out, so take a look before midnight tonight for up to 20% off of lodging and up to 50% off of lift tickets.
