<h4><strong>March 22, 2023 | 7:30 AM</strong><strong></strong></h4><h4><strong style="font-size: 2em;">Morning Report</strong></h4><p>Another beautiful day is ahead of us here at Sunday River. Our team is out preparing to open 13 lifts at 9 AM this morning. Cold temps overnight allowed our grooming team to put down some perfect corduroy stripes, and conditions will be smooth, flowy, and firm this morning. By the afternoon, snow will surely soften up amazingly as the sun comes out for the day. Natural ungroomed terrain still has plenty of snow coverage, but are pretty skied off and bumped up at this point. Give those trails some time to get a little sun and warmth. By mid-day, those moguls should be softer and more enjoyable.</p><p>Overall the forecast is predicting another gorgeous week in western Maine. For today, we are seeing temperatures reaching the 40s by mid-afternoon, low winds, and partially cloudy skies.
