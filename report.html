<h5>January 15, 2022</h5><p>Good afternoon! Please note, <strong>d</strong><b>ue to weather, we've made the decision to close at 4PM today, canceling twilight skiing and Apr&egrave;s Aglow. If you purchased twilight-specific tickets or reserved a time for Apr&egrave;s Aglow, you will be issued a refund. No action is required by you.&nbsp;</b>Hope you've all been staying warm! We've opened up the Chondola and White Cap Quad, but at this time, many of our lifts are still on wind hold. There's still a few more hours to get your runs in, though! I salute all you hardcore skiers and riders out there today. Stay warm! Coming up this week, it looks like Mother Nature is going to bless us with a dumping of snow Monday! Keep those snow dances coming. We deserve a powder day after all these cold temps.&nbsp;</p><p>Please note that ski-in access to the Jordan Hotel requires the navigation of intermediate trails.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Around the Resort</strong><o:p></o:p></p><p>We've got some fun events coming up! <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/wicked-air-and-apres">Wicked Air &amp; Apr&egrave;s</a> is returning to Barker on January 22.
