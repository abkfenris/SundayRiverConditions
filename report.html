<h4><strong>December 26, 2022 | 6:35 AM</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></h4><h2><strong>Morning Update</strong><span></span></h2><p>Good morning; we hope you all had a fantastic Christmas yesterday and are well-rested to ski and ride on this beautiful Monday. Temps will range from 15-26 degrees today, winds should stay relatively calm, and clouds will come and go throughout the day.</p><p>Our Mountain Ops team scattered the resort last night, turning on snow guns and grooming trails. This morning they will finish putting down those perfect stripes and getting the lifts warmed up for another great day. Active snowmaking may be present today on Lower Risky Business, Lower Cascades, Tempest, Obsesion, Heats on, and lower starlight.</p><p>The Team has worked tirelessly to prepare for a significant expansion of open terrain, and that day has finally come. The North Peak Express and Quantum Leap Triple will be available today, as well as the opening debut of our new <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/jordan-8-grand-opening">Jordan 8!</a> We are excited to share this new lift with everyone beginning at 9:30 AM. These lifts will provide access to new trails today, such as Air Glow, Lalapalooza, Excalibur, State Fair, Firestar, and Cyclone.</p><p>There are some important notes to keep in mind as we move through the morning. Parking at the Jordan Hotel is limited, and parking on the roadways is not permitted. Please allow yourself time to traverse the resort. First chair will depart the terminal at 9:30 AM. The Jordan Mountain Double will begin spinning at 8 AM, providing ski-out access from the Jordan Bowl. Most importantly, don't miss out on your chance to win a seat on the first chair! Details will be available in person, so make sure your at the bottom of the Jordan 8 by 9 AM.&nbsp; We are just excited as you are to start exploring westward and see what it's like; as always, check the mountain report for any updates on lift and trail statuses.</p><p>&nbsp;We will see you at Jordan!<br />-Team Snow</p><p>NOTICE: Uphill access will NOT be allowed at Jordan Bowl today.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
