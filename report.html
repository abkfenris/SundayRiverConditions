Afternoon Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: March 15, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 1:46 PM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>A bit of surprise snow is a wonderful way to start the weekend. With about 4" up at the peaks, today was a fun day. The warmer temps down low made for some softer turns, while the cooler temps up high meant drier snow.&nbsp; It's still overcast here at the mountain, and these clouds will linger through the night. We're looking at similar temperatures tomorrow, as well.&nbsp;</p><p>Our grooming team will hit all of the same trails as they did last night. They'll also be adding the Merrill Hill trails to the list, as well as Cowardly Lion. We have 750 acres of open terrain, and our grooming team will put corduroy down on about 75 open trails. With cruisers like Excalibur and Escapade, groomers like White Heat and Obsession, and glades like Lost Princess and Emerald City, there's something for everyone here.&nbsp;Make sure to check out the lift and terrain status below for the most up-to-date information.&nbsp;</p><p>Looking at season passes for next season?
