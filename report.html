Afternoon Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: February 6, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 1:10 PM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>We're tipping into another excellent afternoon of skiing and riding. Temps are continuing to warm across all eight peaks, and it's just fantastic out there.</p><p>For this evening, snowmaking will continue to take advantage of the cold nights, making snow in a few key areas and stockpiling while temps persist. We're looking at a bit of a warm-up coming later this week, so they're planning on taking a few well-deserved down days until the next cold snap.</p><p>Grooming will have a busy schedule, putting stripes back across the mountain. The big news - White Heat is expected to open as a groomed trail tomorrow for the first time this season. Getting there for first tracks is going to be a must.</p><p><a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/presidents-week" title="Presidents' Week | Sunday River, Maine">Presidents' Week</a> will be here before we know it, and we have events planned for the whole family.
