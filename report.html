<p><strong>November 27, 2022 | 1:34 PM</strong></p><p>The sun is shining, the weather is mild, and we are currently skiing and riding on the <strong>most open terrain in New England.</strong> All in all, it's been another amazing day here in the mountains of Western Maine.&nbsp; As we move through the evening, some less-than-frozen precipitation is possible, but nothing we can't handle. The grooming team will be ready and waiting to pounce once the front moves through, with all eyes set on a full refresh in the early hours of the morning. We'll have all the updates ready and waiting for you in the AM, so keep your eyes here for the latest.</p><p>&nbsp;- Team Snow</p><p></p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
