<h5>January 13, 2022</h5><p><span>Good morning Sunday River skiers and riders! Happy Thursday, AKA the warmest day of this week. If there was any day this week to play hooky and go skiing instead, today is the day! We've got to savor these two digit temps, because they will be gone by this weekend. Layering lots is recommended! Temps allowed for snowmaking last night, giving a refresh to Sunday Punch, Express Lane, and Jibe. Groomers lay down stripes all across the mountain, including newly-groomed Salvation. Grab a coffee at <a href="/resort-dining/coffee-hound" title="coffee hound">South Ridge</a> or a hot chocolate with all the toppings at <a href="/resort-shopping/bettys-treats-and-treasures" title="betty's treats and treasures">Betty's Treats and Treasures</a> before hopping on first chair at 9AM. Time for some Thursday turns!</span></p><p>The White Heat Quad is scheduled to come back online this morning.
