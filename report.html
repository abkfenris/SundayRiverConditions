Yes, please. The winds of this morning wound down by late morning, and all of our scheduled lifts are currently spinning. The sun is out, the skies are clear, and we're having a great day. Check out glades like Celestial and Gnarnia for some fun in the trees, or try your hand at some bumps on trails like American Express and Tempest. When your legs are tired, head to one of our slopeside decks for some apr&egrave;s in the sunshine.&nbsp;</p><p>Our grooming team will be pushing out the trails tonight, turning these bumps into corduroy. It will be a similar list of terrain as last night, except for the Merrill Hill trails. Backside, Polaris, and Three Mile Trail will receive a groom tonight for the second night in a row. Our snowmaking team will also be out tonight, and they'll be adding some snow to Lollapalooza and Rogue Angel.
