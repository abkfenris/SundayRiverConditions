Head to the top of one of Sunday River's peaks for a cool breeze and phenomenal views of Western Maine, the White Mountains, and the Mahoosuc Mountains.<strong>&nbsp;Don't forget to bring plenty of water, sunscreen, a hat, suitable footwear,</strong> and some salty snacks to replace what you sweat out. Water bottle filling stations are located in South Ridge Lodge, as well as the hotels! Heavy rains have taken a toll on our trails. Please wear sturdy walking shoes and <strong>be prepared for mud!</strong></p><p><strong>Trails E and A are open from North Peak,</strong> but with a little detour; head to Second Mile and take a left up Three Mile to connect. If you&rsquo;re not sure of your route, please check with the Chondola operators to make sure you have a safe plan. Due to construction, be on the lookout for additional trail closure signage this week including&nbsp; North Peak and the bottom of the Spruce Triple.&nbsp;</p><p>Construction continues on North Peak, which has impacted our trail conditions - please be wary of large holes and don't hike alone if you are unsure of your abilities. Expect frequent changes to access routes to trails H (kid&rsquo;s Adventure Trail) and E (Summit Traverse) from the top of the Chondola. If you are having trouble finding your way, please ask one of our knowledgeable lift operators or patrollers and they will be able to assist you!&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Please adhere to all posted signs and warnings</strong>. Do not cross orange ropes or enter areas beyond &ldquo;no trespassing&rdquo; or &ldquo;trail closed due to construction&rdquo; signs. There are plenty of tables and chairs around North Peak lodge for you to enjoy a picnic lunch or sunny siesta with a view, but please remember to dispose of your trash and recycling at the top or bottom of the lift.</p><p>As you head to South Ridge base area, you may notice we have begun <strong>construction on Barker Mountain Rd.</strong> During the week, Monday - Friday, there will be limited access depending where the crew is working. Most access will be allowed via Cascade Hotel Hill Dr. Weekend traffic will flow as normal.</p><p>If you are injured or need assistance at any point, please contact&nbsp;<strong>Patrol at (207)-824-5350</strong>&nbsp;or visit our First Aid Clinic in the bottom of the South Ridge Lodge next to Betty's Treats and Treasures.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
