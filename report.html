<p><strong>December 11, 2022 | 1:00 PM&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Although it wasn't a perfect bluebird day, visibility was still excellent, and skiers and riders were out there ripping. The groomed trails provided great terrain for carving wide turns and dialing in that technique for the season. Other runs with active snowmaking are becoming playgrounds filled with waves and whalebacks. The <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/santa-sunday">Santas</a> took to the slopes this morning, filling the lift lines and spreading holiday spirit.<br />Going into the week, the Mtn Ops team will focus on making more snow around the resort to expand our already impressive open terrain. The snow cats will make their way to all skiable terrain to groom out that perfect corduroy. Mother nature is giving us hope that winter is on its way with colder temperatures ahead and possible snowfall at the end of the week going into next weekend.
