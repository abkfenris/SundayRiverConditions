<p><strong>February 2, 2022</strong></p><p>Happy hump day and happy Groundhog Day, Sunday River! This morning, <span>Punxsutawney Phil (the all-knowing groundhog) saw his shadow, meaning we're in for six more weeks of winter. Thanks Phil! We'll take a few more weeks than six, actually. But today's a lucky day, too - it's 2/2/22! All these signs... the universe is telling you: it's a good day to ski. The sun is peeking out from behind the clouds, and with almost 800 acres open, we've got something for everyone. Groomers lay down stripes on over 80 trails last night, giving you lots of corduroy to carve on. You might even be able to find some secret stashes left over from this weekend's storm if you venture into the woods. Also, looks like Mother Nature is bringing us a refresh Thursday night into Friday. We're seeing reports of 6-12" for our area! Lets get the snow dances going. </span></p><p><span>First chair is 9AM - see you there!</span></p><p>Please note that ski-in access to the Jordan Hotel requires the navigation of intermediate trails to reach Jordan Bowl.</p><p><strong>Around the Resort</strong></p><p>OutRyders is partnering with Sunday River to bring you <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/pride-weekend.xml">Pride Weekend</a> this February 4-6!
