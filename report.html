Afternoon Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: April 4, 2024 </strong></em><strong>| 1:00 PM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>Gotta love a good spring powder day! Even with the wind, we still got some great turns off Spruce and White Cap and the snow never stopped. We've picked up another 2" of snow through today, and it looks like we've still got a good chunk of the storm to go through. Winds look more favorable to operation tomorrow, so that could be another great opportunity to track up some of the areas that weren't able to open today. We won't know for certain what will and won't open until we get into it tomorrow, but it could be pretty sweet. Keep your eyes out for tomorrow's AM report for all the deets.</p><p>This storm is going to create some great conditions this weekend, which is perfect timing to book a spring<a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/lessons/private-lessons" title="Private Ski and Snowboard Lessons"> ski or snowboard lesson</a>.
