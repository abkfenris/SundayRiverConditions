<h4><strong>December 26, 2022 | 1:10 PM</strong></h4><h2><strong>Afternoon Update</strong><span></span></h2><p>It was a historic day here at Sunday River. Skiers and riders made their way to Jordan Bowl this morning to celebrate the new Jordan 8 Lift opening and ski some newly opened terrain for the year. Thank you to everyone who made it out for the opening celebrations!</p><p>Going into the night, our Mountain Ops team will get back out there blowing snow and grooming out open trails by mixing new snow into the base in order to soften up that top layer. As the week goes on, we hope to open more trails and lifts for you to check out and explore.</p><p>The day isn't over yet, and there is still plenty to do. We will have twilight skiing until 6:30 tonight out of South Ridge and fireworks at the Jordan Bowl to continue our <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/christmas-vacation-weeks">Christmas week</a> festivities.</p><p>Please Note: Because of the fireworks, Lalapalooza will be closed to non-hotel guests at 2:45.</p><p>Tomorrow looks like another classic day of east coast skiing with temps in the teens, some clouds here and there, and groomers as far as the eye can see.</p><p>We will see you out there!</p><p>-Team Snow</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
