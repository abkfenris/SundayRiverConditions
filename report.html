<h4><strong>January 13, 2023 | 7:30 AM</strong></h4><h2><strong>Morning Update</strong><span></span></h2><p>Good morning Sunday River riders and rippers; mother nature is testing our team once again. Yesterday's snowfall did not stop, and the snow kept coming down until late into the night. At around 2 AM, a warm front came in, bringing unsettling weather. These warm temps and scattered light showers will continue on and off throughout the day. The 4-6" of snow we received in the last 24 hours will help protect the rest of the snowpack, and should get us through today with softer playful trail conditions.</p><p>Our Mountain ops team got to it early in the night to groom out all open terrain on the resort besides Lost Princess. Keep an eye on the <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/mountain-report">mountain report</a> today as ski patrol makes their way onto the hill to inspect trail conditions,&nbsp; drop ropes and open new trails.</p><p>Best to bring the extra waterproof gear today if you want to get out there and make the most of the freshly fallen snow, But a couple of trash bag ponchos will do just fine. <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/booklodging?Checkin=2023-1-12&amp;Checkout=&amp;Adults=2&amp;Children=0&amp;Others=0#/room" target="_blank" title="One night stays" rel="noopener">One night stays</a> are now available for MLK Weekend at the Grand Summit and Snow Cap Inn.&nbsp; Availability is limited.&nbsp;</p><p>If your staying around for the week with your little rippers make sure to head to <strong><a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/things-to-do/events/events/black-diamond/laser-tag">Laser Tag</a></strong> at the Ballroom at Grand Summit Hotel tonight from&nbsp; 5-7PM!</p><p><strong>Please note:</strong> There is currently no beginner terrain into and out of the Grand Summit Hotel.</p><p>See you on the slopes!</p><p>-Team Snow</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
