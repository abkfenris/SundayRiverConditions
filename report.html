<h4><strong>December 18, 2022 | 1:15 PM</strong></h4><h2><strong>Afternoon Update</strong></h2><p>Let's hope you made the right decision and could make it to the mountain today! The snow was groomed overnight and created conditions that were almost too good, even for the most experienced east coast skier. Edges sank into the corduroy and took you for a ride as you carved with ease. Temperatures stayed comfortable, and the wind was calm throughout the day. Our power issues were solved, and we were able to run ten lifts with no problems.</p><p>Into the night, our Mountain Ops team will be back at it, turning the snow guns back on and creating new snow on Aurora and Jordan peaks in hopes of opening new terrain before the holiday season. Snow Cats will also get out on the mountain, grooming out all open terrain in preparation for the coming week. It looks like winter is here to stay as temps remain low this week, and possible snowfall is on the way. Keep an eye out for opening trails throughout the week as ski patrol inspects the mountain and begins to drop more ropes for skiing and riding.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;Winter has only just begun!<br />-Team Snow</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
