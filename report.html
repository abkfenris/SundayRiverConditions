<h4><strong>March 4, 2023 | 6:30 AM</strong><strong></strong></h4><h4><strong style="font-size: 2em;">Morning Report</strong></h4><p>Happy Saturday, indeed! Here at Sunday River, 4" of light cotton candy powder has already created a beautiful layer throughout the resort. Snow continues to fall hard as our team and guests arrive in preparation for a ridiculous day of fresh snow skiing.</p><p>Although snowcats took to the whole mountain last night and are even on the beginner terrain early this morning, it might be hard to notice by the time first chair comes around. We are forecasted to get over 2" of beautiful freshies per hour. And this storm is not leaving anytime soon either. Snow will continue to come down throughout the day until around 7 when things seem to calm down. When all is said and done, there will be a beautiful blanket of about 10-14".</p><p>All 19 lifts will run today, and 100% of our terrain is open. Visibility may be tricky today, and temps will stick around the high 20s to low 30s. Grab your stuff, clean the snow off your car, and make your way over for a dream of a day on our eight peaks. Drive safe, ski safe, know your limits, and most importantly, have fun.</p><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Want to enjoy the snow we have been getting recently?
