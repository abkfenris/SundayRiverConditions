<h4><strong>January 25, 2023 | 1:35 PM</strong></h4><h4><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h4><strong style="font-size: 2em;">Afternoon Report</strong></h4><h2><span></span></h2><p>The fresh snow from the last few days packed down amazingly after the grooming team's hard work last night. Today's trail conditions were smooth like butter and easily held edges as carving tracks began to cover our terrain. Fresh pockets of snow are still around for those out there searching for it. More snow is on its way, starting with flurries as early as 2 PM this afternoon. Snowfall should continue throughout the night and into Thursday as well. We are keeping a close eye on temperatures here at the base, and the peaks of our mountains as the forecasts are claiming a rapid rise in temperatures beginning mid-morning tomorrow. We are hoping for the best going into the middle of Thursday that temps will remain as low as possible until this storm has finished passing by sometime in the late afternoon tomorrow.</p><p>Our team will keep the snow guns off tonight and let Mother Nature do its thing. The groomers will hit the resort tonight and groom out what they deem necessary, as well as push around snow piles from the long week of snowmaking on our eight peaks. Beginner trails on South Ridge, North Peak, and White Cap will get groomed out smooth early in the morning tomorrow to pack down any fresh snow we will receive tonight.
