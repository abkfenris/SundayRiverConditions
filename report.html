<p><strong>December 2, 2022 | 7:43 AM</strong></p><p>What better way to end the week than with abundant sunshine, comfortable temps, and perfect corduroy? We can't think of anything, but if you can, let us know. Our snowmaking team had an incredibly productive thanks to the cold temps, burying South Ridge in fresh snow. The grooming team took to the higher peaks to work their magic, with all signs pointing towards an excellent groom. Please note, due to active snowmaking, South Ridge did not receive a groom last night and as such is not considered beginner terrain at this time. The snowmakers will stay after it as long as temps allow, so be sure to stop and thank them for all of the hard work they've put in.</p><p>We'll see you out there!</p><p>&nbsp;- Team Snow</p><p></p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
