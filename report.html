<strong>November 25, 2021</strong></p><p style="text-align: left;">There's something about carving turns before carving turkey. It's been a fun Thanksgiving Day on the slopes with groomed terrain on Right Stuff, Cascades, Ecstasy, Jungle Road, and Sunday Punch and terrain park features on Upper Sunday Punch. We're getting ready to do it all again tomorrow! The snowcats will put down stripes overnight, and we expect snowmaking temperatures to return by tomorrow afternoon. Please note that all terrain is for advanced skiers and riders only. We'll catch you on the Locke Mountain Triple and Barker Mountain Express tomorrow from 8AM-3:45PM, and stay tuned for more terrain by the weekend.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: left;">We're now open to day tickets, ticket packs, and season passes, which should be <a href="https://shop.sundayriver.com/" title="online store">purchased online in advance</a>. <span style="font-weight: 400;"> Have your RFID from last year? You can head straight to the lift!</span>&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: 400;">All skier services will be based out of Barker Lodge. Season Pass Office is also open at South Ridge Lodge and we will have shuttle service between Barker, South Ridge, and the hotels while the lifts spin.
