<h5>January 14, 2022</h5><p>Happy Friday Sunday River skiers and riders! The snowmakers took advantage of the cold temps to refresh trails like Jibe and Sunday Punch, as well as burying Shockwave and Top Gun with eyes set on expansion. Snowmaking will be coming offline tonight and tomorrow but will be back in time to help Mother Nature blanket the mountain on Monday. Vortex received a top-to-bottom makeover from the groomers, who pressed perfect corduroy across all eight peaks. USASA is hosting a slopestyle event on T72 today, so the trail will be closed to the public.
