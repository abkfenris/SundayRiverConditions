<h4><strong>March 10, 2023 | 7:30 AM</strong><strong></strong></h4><h4><strong style="font-size: 2em;">Morning Report</strong></h4><p>How are we doing this morning, fellow snow lovers? The sky is as clear as can be on this beautiful Friday morning here in Newry. The sun is shining bright as it rises over the distant mountains. Fresh groomed trails glisten, and the crisp air remains calm.</p><p>We are starting up 13 lifts for the day, accessing beautifully groomed terrain. Trails will start the day firm and fast. However, as the sun shines on our eight peaks, things will soften up and become more playful. We have recently opened up our Flow State course to the public on Rocking Chair just to add to the fun. Remember the South Ridge Express and the Chondola will run until 6:30 tonight and tomorrow. A great way to enjoy golden hour views and the distant sunset during some twilight skiing and riding.&nbsp;</p><p>It's going to be another sunny mild day out there today with temperatures in the high 30s, a great start to what looks like another fantastic weekend here in western Maine.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/season-passes"> <strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">2023-24 New England Passes </span></strong></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">are now available</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">.
