</p><p style="color: #696969; font-weight: 900; font-size: 12px;">WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 10</p><div><p>What. A. Day. The conditions have been killer all day, thanks to the beautiful dusting of snow we got yesterday and the sun warming up the mountain this morning. If you haven't made it out yet today, we strongly suggest you finish up your work day early to sneak in a few runs before the lifts stop spinning. The snow is perfect for incredibly fun skiing and there's trails all across the resort to explore. Looking forward to the weekend, we may see some fresh flakes, so keep the snow dances coming. If you can't make it up this afternoon, lifts open at 9AM tomorrow - it'll be a perfect day for first chair.</p><p>Looking ahead to the holiday, we have quite the line-up for <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/events/presidents-week">Presidents' Day Weekend</a> and week. Keep in mind lift tickets are limited and days are already selling out, so plan ahead if you want to hit the slopes next week. Or <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/booklodging">book lodging</a> with us and guarantee access to full-day lift tickets.&nbsp;</p><p><span>Please note that kids ski school lessons are now available to <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/lessons/kids-lessons" target="_blank" rel="noopener">book online&nbsp;</a>with limited availability.</span></p><p><span>We are&nbsp;</span><a title="Online Store" href="https://shop.sundayriver.com/s/lift-tickets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>requiring online lift ticket purchase</strong></a><span>&nbsp;and setting </span><strong>limits on the number of tickets</strong><span>&nbsp;sold for each day. This includes full-day, half-day, beginner, Threedom additional days, and Passholder Friend tickets. We only expect these limits to affect peak dates, but encourage everyone to buy early to ensure access on the dates you want. Season passes, Ikon passes, and lift ticket packs remain direct-to-lift with no restrictions or reservations.</span></p><p><span>Fast and contactless lift ticket pickup is available at our PUBs (Pick Up Boxes) at base lodges and hotels. Just scan the barcode at the bottom of your confirmation email and your RFID cards will print with your lift tickets or ticket packs loaded. For best results turn off dark mode on your phone if you use it and avoid email apps that use dark backgrounds.</span></p><p><span>Please remember to take a self-administered </span><a title="Health Screening" href="https://www.sundayriver.com/covid">Health Screening</a><span> and visit our&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/covid">COVID Winter Guide</a><span>&nbsp;before each trip to stay up-to-date on safety protocols and state guidelines.</span></p><p>Point 'em downhill!</p><p><span>Team Snow</span></p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
