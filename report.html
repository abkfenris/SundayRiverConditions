<h4><strong>January 10, 2023 | 4:35 PM</strong></h4><h2><strong>Afternoon Update</strong><span></span></h2><p>It's been an absolutely beautiful day here at the mountain. Snow squalls this morning created a natural snow globe, and clouds gave way to bluebird skies this afternoon. The grooming team will get back on the hill this evening, with intentions of resurfacing nearly all open terrain. The list keeps growing, and they keep crushing it. Temps stayed cool throughout the day, which has allowed our snowmakers to keep the guns running. Temps stay in the perfect range all the way until Thursday night, so we're expecting some serious whales.</p><p>Speaking of Thursday, our next storm is rolling in. In typical New England fashion, this storm is proving challenging to forecast. It is looking like warming will occur on the tail end of the front, but the good news is any liquid precipitation is looking minimal at this point, with a heavy thump of snow at the onset. Stay tuned here for all of the details as we move through the week.</p><p><strong>Please note:</strong> There is currently no beginner terrain into and out of the Grand Summit Hotel.</p><p>See you on the slopes!</p><p>-Team Snow</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
