Morning Report</strong><strong style="font-size: 2em;"></strong></h4><h5><em><strong>Last Updated: November 21, 2023 </strong></em><strong>| 7:32AM</strong><strong></strong></h5><p>The sun is rising, the skies are clear, the air is crisp and cold, and we're gearing up for another superb day on snow. Our grooming team took to Lollapalooza and Grand Ave last night, leaving fresh corduroy behind them. Our parks team was busy moving the hike-park to the bottom of Excalibur, which will be open for access today. And our Snowmaking team has been jumping at every chance to continue to make snow, with their eyes set on expansion. We hope you're able to sneak in a few laps today to help warm up for tomorrow. If you haven't taken a peek at the radar, it's sure looking good. Keep your fingers crossed in the meantime, enjoy today, and we'll see you out there!</p><p>For those needing ticket assistance, a Guest Service station is located in the bottom terminal of the Jordan 8. All Ikon Pass holders who need assistance must visit the Welcome Center in the South Ridge Base Lodge. Additionally, from now until December 1, all rentals for Type 2 skiers and above, can be made, in person only, at the Sunday River Rental Shop. The equipment rental shop is located in the tunnel at the South Ridge base area.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Please note that early-season, variable terrain will be present on all trails.
