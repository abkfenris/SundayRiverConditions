We had sunny skies, classic December temps, and fresh corduroy on almost all of our open terrain. We're ready to do it all again tomorrow. Who's aiming for the first chair of 2024?</p><p>Our snowmaking system has been operating at 100% capacity since yesterday afternoon, and it will continue to run at capacity until temps say otherwise, blasting 10,000 gallons of water per minute across the resort. Our Mountain Ops team is great at what they do, and we're aiming for significant terrain expansion over the next couple of days. Our grooming team will be out tonight, polishing up almost all of our open terrain for tomorrow.&nbsp;</p><p>Somehow 2024 is in less than twelve hours, and we have events planned for the rest of the day. We have extended twilight skiing until 8PM, a kids-only party, a <a href="https://shop.sundayriver.com/s/events/p/foggy-goggle-new-years-eve-party" title="Foggy Goggle New Year's Eve Party | Sunday River, Maine">21+ party</a>, <a href="https://www.sundayriver.com/fireworks" title="Fireworks | Sunday River, Maine">fireworks</a>, and more.

The Chondola is now open.</p><p>Thanks to the amazing efforts of our snowmakers, we have tentative plans to open the Jordan Bowl on Wednesday, January 3. This will include ski-in, ski-out access to the Jordan Hotel. The Alpeniglu is scheduled to re-open on Friday, January 5, as well as the Outpost, for convenient slopeside snacks and beverages. Snowmaking temps will be crucial, but the forecast looks promising, and our snowmakers are working hard.</p><p>Think cold, and we'll see you out there!</p><p>- Team Snow</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><!-- END IMAGE BLOCK --><!-- TEXT BLOCK -->&nbsp; <!--===// BODY SECTION===--><!--Template Body End-->
